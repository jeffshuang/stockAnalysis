MajorBuzzkill,,2019-03-25 09:47:00,1.667,CRMD this had so much hope during PM when it shot up to 179
Mikep7703,,2019-03-25 09:44:00,1.67,CRMD this looks like its just gonna be sideways today close around 175 maybe
Nednerb1,True,2019-03-25 09:42:00,1.678,CRMD Just curious what if this dumps and the RS leaves it less than 5 per share Do we just hope it gets to 5 so tutes can buy
zigzag001,,2019-03-25 09:41:00,1.677,CRMD Investors are waiting it out today until last minute to see if this will drop lower before purchasing IMO
HigherDesires,True,2019-03-25 09:41:00,1.677,CRMD tbh Id rather the RS have no movement all those who sold n have been waiting 2 reload after RS deserve to get left
erdunlap,True,2019-03-25 09:39:00,1.672,CRMD the hunt for cheap shares begins
chromashadows,,2019-03-25 09:37:00,1.688,CRMD is lagging Sp lower Than the 173 here
