ottonad,,2019-03-25 14:56:00,18.42,CSIQ May Q1 ER will bring a pop with Q2 guidance The Q1 results are already priced in
ottonad,,2019-03-25 14:54:00,18.415,CSIQ Hey you are still at the Dec 2017 private offer price take it now Lol
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:50:00,18.461,CSIQ i guess the big question is given such punishment on ER is thinking big like 40s and 50s simply a waste of time and a dream
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:48:00,18.468,CSIQ from 2589 to 1847 thats a 7 point drop on a stellar 2018 with debt reduction and 2019 a blip year very sad
ottonad,,2019-03-25 14:42:00,18.467,CSIQ Nobody expects 2019 to be a huge growth year either and companies dont pad beginning rev estimates
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:40:00,18.43,CSIQ all i hope for is no more low ball private offers the flush gives opportunity for that hoping the go private offers stay far away
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:37:00,18.433,CSIQ like come on they had the strongest year in 2018 against their peers and the reward for that is a massive flush Can we ever win here
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:36:00,18.45,CSIQ it must hold this support above 1820 because if it does not i fear we will trade between 15 to 18 again which will suck big time
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:35:00,18.435,CSIQ we all thought the next leg up was 25 to 30 zone the problem is clearly no one saw 2019 as a temporary blip on the profit growth
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:33:00,18.455,CSIQ the crappy thing is every single time CSIQ plunges from 23 to 24 it takes long time to recover the exception was aug 2015 to dec 2015
ShortChinaSolar,,2019-03-25 14:31:00,18.435,CSIQ i dont agree with the timing thing in 2019 there is no growth in the numbers hence the plunge 2019 WAS NOT expected to be so soft
ottonad,,2019-03-25 14:28:00,18.493,CSIQ Lets do some easy math Q1 guidance is 450480M Full yr guidance is 3538B Q24 rev avg is 1011B Much ado about timing
