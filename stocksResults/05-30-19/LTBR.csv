ECerus,,2019-05-30 11:36:00,0.8001,LTBR Dilution was going to happen not my favorite In the longer run this will not even register as a blip Trying to make myself internalize that Its not easy but its real Thinking of it as upping the DoE contribution ratio
fred54,,2019-05-30 11:23:00,0.8101,LTBR heres an idea wait until next CC If Seth sold via atm it means no utility and RS is inevitable no matter what he says on CC If he didnt theres a chance
WouldYaLookAtThat,True,2019-05-30 11:16:00,0.8028,LTBR thanks low vol shorts
Dr_Monkey,,2019-05-30 11:16:00,0.8028,LTBR Eventually we will learn who the new baggies are I smell freshly diluted shares They are cognizant of dilution all right They will be prudent HA How prudent were they in granting their salary increases Cognizant only means they are aware what they are doing and who they are doing it to Not that they care

fred54,,2019-05-30 11:13:00,0.8,LTBR so figure Seth sold 12 million shares at 95 cents to bolster coffers by about 400k was it worth it moron Seth Now you have 0 credibility

pandffan,False,2019-05-30 11:10:00,0.7999,LTBR where did all of the new bag holders on this board this morning come from somebody set this up
pandffan,False,2019-05-30 11:06:00,0.7951,LTBR classic you can pretty much set your watch by this one now
fred54,,2019-05-30 11:05:00,0.7966,LTBR wow talk about another collapse Another typical ugly intraday reversal Looks like 70 is coming
WouldYaLookAtThat,,2019-05-30 10:58:00,0.8197,LTBR Just another example stupid algos running on keywords
brianb3,,2019-05-30 10:58:00,0.8197,LTBR if they had ONLY released the response to the rejection wed probably close green today at a reasonable mid 80s level Would have helped solidify 80 as a base Honestly Id have dipped my toes back in I thought that response was pretty good Now Id be very surprised if it doesnt close down from yesterday after these shenanigans

fred54,,2019-05-30 10:48:00,0.8299,LTBR If no utility contract by next CC this is getting hammered My guess is Seth knows no utility K coming and selling on this news with RS itll be hard to sell stock

enterprising,,2019-05-30 10:16:00,0.8525,LTBR sentiment and price action reminds me of pre JV times
fred54,,2019-05-30 10:14:00,0.8462,LTBR nothing makes any sense Thats why rejected by DOE First they are going to test LTR w5 fuel yet they need 195 Ok So theyll use conventional reactor conditions to test other things THEN theyll go in a commercial reactor with HALEU but the commercial reactor will need NRC approval to use HALEU Where does that come from
leeza1007,,2019-05-30 10:10:00,0.8339,LTBR Whats on twitter is totally opposite their website Shorts
fred54,,2019-05-30 10:10:00,0.8339,LTBR you guys dont get it The fuel needs HALEU Without it there is nothing special To test it LTA in a commercial reactor you need that reactor to get approval to use HALEU in the reactor The NRC isnt simply going to let say Exelon place a uranium fuel inside their reactor without testing And testing LTBR rods w5 isnt going to be sufficient
leeza1007,True,2019-05-30 10:07:00,0.8288,LTBR Anyone can open a twitter account hiwever this is on the companys webpage irltbridgecomnewsreleas
enterprising,True,2019-05-30 10:04:00,0.8307,LTBR the cats out of the bag and hopefully a utility contract will be too I mean think about it The wheels are in motion the price is arbitrary even at 2 it is undervalued
Arpeggio,,2019-05-30 10:04:00,0.8307,LTBR they have 5 months to gain compliance with NASDQ NOTHING recently released from LTBR or Framatome would suggest a mechanism to do so Nothing other than a RS makes sense at this pointUNLESSbigger news to follow If nothere comes another RS

mrviking,True,2019-05-30 09:56:00,0.8564,LTBR Its pretty predictable how the shorts and traders run this minivolume stock 100K on many normal days but the long perspective keeps improving and were even getting better coms from the management ltbridgecomwpcontentupl This doesnt excuse some of the CEOs lesser qualities but this is now a bet on Framatome as well with Nuscale approaching
Dbowlin,True,2019-05-30 09:55:00,0.8551,LTBR maybe all this leads to that utility announcement
PLATINUM_TRADES,,2019-05-30 09:54:00,0.86,LTBR this is why you dont listen to just anybody Trade carefully Watch the chart and wait for a bounce
BusinessClass,,2019-05-30 09:53:00,0.86,LTBR I agree the news is not worth the pump or the volume but lightbridge couldnt release it until framatome did thats why they did now They did do something like this before the truly big news with the JV last time so lets see
Smoothmoves1,,2019-05-30 09:50:00,0.8513,LTBR wow probably the worst stock Ive ever bought into in one day Yikes This is going to be a long bag hold
fred54,,2019-05-30 09:46:00,0.8561,LTBR the utter disgust the loss of all credibility this stock is untouchable It also means no utility K is imminent or why stoop to such lows The DOE rejection I think is the nail in the coffin Now its just desperation
Dr_Monkey,,2019-05-30 09:45:00,0.8615,LTBR the uninformed are in abundance This is evidence of how stocks trade merely on PR Old GAIN news used as new to offset latest DOE rejection I think thats why they never sent it out when it occurred just handed someone a few thousand of my 60 cent shares Why not Ill take them back in a few days at a fraction

fred54,,2019-05-30 09:34:00,0.8712,LTBR in my opinion regurgitating old news after ATM means no utility contract That was petty and desperate
fred54,,2019-05-30 09:33:00,0.8762,LTBR on the next CC it will be interesting to see if the atm was used this quarter like in February Its almost like that moron wants a RS
