Glopolon,,2019-05-30 11:18:00,1.55,CPAH Im not here to say this will go up or down Im only pointing out that they have a going concern and they will probably raise capital in some fashion and that the market is wary of under funded microcaps
Glopolon,,2019-05-30 11:13:00,1.45,CPAH During the nine months ended January 31 2019 we received proceeds of 2000000 under a loan agreement
Glopolon,,2019-05-30 11:11:00,1.45,CPAH 285K cash used per month in the past 9 months From Feb 1 to June 1 a little over 1m cash used from the 17m total So like I have said they probably have under 1m as of June 1
Michael_Hunt,True,2019-05-30 11:00:00,1.422,CPAH same space as ELTK micro float bottom bouncer Honeywell news coming Wake up Idiots on here scrutinizing financials as if somebody with a 7M market cap is squeaky clean No surprise that retail loses their ass 99 of the time

Michael_Hunt,True,2019-05-30 10:24:00,1.55,CPAH Im quite amazed at folks inability to read financial statements Go look at the statement of cash flows in the last 10Q they burned 2574M cash through operating activities during the 9 months ended March 31 meaning they burn roughly 850k a Q Further they had 1774M in the bank on 331 PLUS 2230M in Accounts Receivable thus these guys have more like a year and 3 months cash All this talk of 500k and running out is hilariously stupid Ill waive from 2 any day
Glopolon,,2019-05-30 10:01:00,1.446,CPAH You can say that their billionaire owner will fund the company and perhaps so but that doesnt change the fact that the market is often wary of low funded microcaps
Glopolon,,2019-05-30 10:00:00,1.446,CPAH Their cash position is probably holding this back They had 17m at Jan 31 2019 they lost a bit over 1m in cash in the last quarter so at that rate they are probably around 500K at May 30
Michael_Hunt,True,2019-05-30 09:47:00,1.5,CPAH they didnt want RWLK sub 3 they didnt want SEEL sub 2 and they are sleeping on CPAH at 150 there isnt an easier 100 in the market when the Honeywell news is PRed Camped out and adding
