mkjms,,2019-05-30 15:41:00,3.88,PRTK basically if you want to buy a stock like PRTK you have to realize it is a crappy business in todays worldbut at some point there will probably be a global freakout about antibiotic resistance and you will see an epic rally Whether that occurs in 1 year or 20 years impossible to time But it is why I would consider a 1 to 2 portfolio allocation and no more Kind of like hurricane insurance

birdball29,,2019-05-30 09:53:00,4.075,PRTK In any event for a small cap abx to be able to go at it alone in this environment shouldnt be condemned rather lauded And itll most certainly be addressed by the powers that be as abx resistance and the need for stewardship is starting to enter the spotlight almost on the same level as opioid epidemic
birdball29,,2019-05-30 09:53:00,4.075,PRTK an you provide the DCF models you used to AT LEAST provide the sp in multiple rNPVs If not then your article isnt creditworthy This article is latent with pure hyperbole inaccuratemisinformation Youve provided absolutely ZERO proprietary information In fact it doesnt deviate from investors on other comment boards At the same time its easy to bash a company in a beaten up space The fact that its had to load up on debt should be viewed as how incredibly prudent management is btwthe converts should be viewed as ridiculously cheap capital should the strike not be hit by 2024 the carry value 475 What would you have recommended they do 100 assume a buyout or partnership leaving it completely exposed should any blips occur ie significant label restrictions etc or not being able to launchscale properly Maybe they shouldve a page out of AKAOs book
birdball29,True,2019-05-30 09:53:00,4.075,PRTK You article has no merit to it whatsoeverWhat are you trying to achieve anyway These articles should expound upon the fundamentals and price assumptions that encompass short medium and long term investors For you to expound upon a narrative purely geared to shortintermediate term investors Whats the definition of noninferiority btw It seems at least plausible then notwithstanding the limitations of crosstrial comparison that nitrofurantoin might not be easy to beat If PRTK cares only about noninferiority and wants to market omadacycline based on its other advantages for example onceaday oral dosing then there is no need to beat nitrofurantoinStock declining on low volumeLow volume pullbacks occur when the price moves towards support levels on lower than average volume Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit but suggest that the longterm uptrend remains intact
