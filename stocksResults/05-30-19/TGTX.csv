aliph,True,2019-05-30 14:54:00,6.511,TGTX I will buy more shares at this price Good luck to all longs
aliph,True,2019-05-30 14:53:00,6.5,TGTX The shorts are using every opportunity to drive the price down This is crazy But until they come out with P3 data and filings this will be a rough ride
aliph,True,2019-05-30 14:52:00,6.49,TGTX No I did not like the interview But have anything really changed Though Bayer got a BT designation for MZL I see TG coming out as a winner among the competition with more value and safe This does test my patience as much as anyone elses at this point But if if we all could predict the price action it would have been nice For now I think being patient and trust the data and management is all I am going to do

theguitardr,,2019-05-30 13:09:00,6.7,TGTX I think the only way sentiment will change for this is if Weiss is replaced as CEO After watching that illadvised interview with Cramer Im concerned about them diluting again He inspired ZERO CONFIDENCE
