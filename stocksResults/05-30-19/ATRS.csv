TDFOR32,True,2019-05-30 12:35:00,2.815,ATRS The lowest price in ATRS 52week share price range is gradually rising as the trading days pass Im assuming it may be indicative of more people becoming aware of the rapidly increasing revenues as revealed in the companys last several quarterly financial reports and in my opinion what appears to be a very bright future for the company as a very fast growth small cap investment both short term and long term
