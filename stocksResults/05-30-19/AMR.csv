ramsey11,True,2019-05-30 14:00:00,0.1325,AMR here comes 15
Growth,True,2019-05-30 13:54:00,0.1321,AMR adjusted my bottom line which seems more accurate as this sets up Good thing my stop loss is 124 and not 1275 planned Still liking this MACD looks to be curling If volume comes in we retest 15 IMO possibly today
zaytoven,True,2019-05-30 12:18:00,0.131,AMR since you dont want To go up Just drop all the way down to 10
Growth,True,2019-05-30 11:45:00,0.1328,AMR ok if she loves me as much as I think she does we should now bounce here and continue back to top of pennant where i expect a break and retest of 15 or break of 15 of she breaks down right here ill likely stop out at 124 otherise holding strong

Fasak,True,2019-05-30 11:20:00,0.1342,AMR Dman20200 you think this still got chance to move 20
Growth,True,2019-05-30 10:45:00,0.1342,AMR has a very similar set up to the CLD chart I just posted although in a different time frame Like CLD breaking out of the Pennant to test that 10 and should break in due time IMO AMR will break up to test 15 again and break in due timeStill holding both bigly and havent sold a share of either Happy Hunting
