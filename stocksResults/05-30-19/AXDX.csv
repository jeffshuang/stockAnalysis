JohnB43,,2019-05-30 15:27:00,18.797,AXDX The shorts continue to dominate the conversation Surprised this is so given the last qtr report and insider buying There must be more to this decline What is it
WhackaMole,True,2019-05-30 14:53:00,18.925,AXDX But I remain committed to this stock through thick and thin Sepsis is a real and growing problem The clinical testing market is ripe for disruption with new technology The shorts are STUCk and paying double digit borrow costs Most of the stock is controlled by Jack Schuyler and Friends who are NOT dummies and have more money that the shorts Time is on our side
WhackaMole,True,2019-05-30 14:50:00,18.88,AXDX Now that business momentum has shifted and the current leasing strategy is clearly working I remain shocked that the shorts recommitted in the face of Jacks buying I understand that there are a dozen different funds borrowing stock on the street it isnt just one Normally short sellers target bankruptable companies with declining business momentum So it remains a mystery why anybody remains stuck in this position no that Andrew Left of Citron has all but left this company and moved on to other targets like CHGG His former 1 price target for us was a joke
WhackaMole,True,2019-05-30 14:46:00,18.86,AXDX I do believe at least one company was kicking the tires on this thing last year I had heard that he price was too low mid 30s But rumors abound in Tucson Its a small town where everybody knows everybody
Esau815,,2019-05-30 10:09:00,19.07,AXDX Just a general note regarding AXDX transparency I believe 2018 taught them a lesson They botched the launch by not segueing into a rental model at the outset They painted rosier sales projections than they should have Understandably the Street put them in the dog house for a while Since that timestarting with JPM 2019 I believe that they have been much improved in terms of where theyre at and whats to be expected They did not sugar coat the respiratory trial delay I believe that the 350 machine placement guidance is doable and might be conservative There should be no surprises for the remainder of 2019 But that first week of 2020 is beyond big If they show a strong 4th quarter number that is the game changer
