WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-05-30 14:47:00,15.643,ENPH Question about converts Does every convert have different terms When normally are you allowed to convert to shares and is it typically at a set strike priceThe August convert had a 556 strike so those note holders have done incredibly well in under a year I think we need to wait and see what the terms are before fully understanding all the implications FYI the shares were down 13 that day quite different from what we see today foolcominvesting201808
WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-05-30 14:41:00,15.58,ENPH So the last convertible happened it was Aug 15 2018 The price when it came out was around 5 and the stock dipped to 4 over the next month or so What an incredible buying opportunity that was So a 20 haircut in the short run That convert was dilutive but was done to pay off a loanshark loan and made real economic sense even at the cost of dilution Today so far the stock is not even down 5 I bought more at around 450 Will have to see what happens when the official terms of this convert are released but right now the market reaction is clearly much more positive which makes sense given that the company is growing and actually profitable

WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-05-30 14:07:00,15.549,ENPH Very interesting analysis of this convert on the Yahoo board Recommend reading all of it Here is part of it It says that management sees the future value of shares being much higher than they are now 1 First point This is non dilutive In fact it is the opposite of dilutive it specifically ELIMINATES the pending dilution from last Augusts convertible note offering without creating new dilution2 Second point the company is in remarkably stronger position than they were 9 months ago and that allows the company to make a deal with the previous CN holders Often convertibles are issued by companies that are teetering That is not the case here In fact the company has done so well since last August when the first CN was issued lets call it CN1 that anyone that took a short position along with their CN has seen any hopes of profiting from that short totally disappear and at this point they are just lenders earning 4 or some leveraged multiple of that

MacSteve07,True,2019-05-30 13:11:00,15.62,ENPH My two centsI assume a final dilution of around 5 Of course such convertible prescriptions are also an invitation to short sellers Eric Branderiz already admitted to complex financial hedges during his time at TeslaHes a smart guy and has provoked several short squeeze on Tesla This has sometimes led to enormous price jumpsThe highlydiscounted Tennenbaum debts were recently redeemed with a similar transactionIt can be assumed that this transaction will also buy back convertible bonds from the last offer or exchange them for ordinary sharesAt the end its probably a mix of juggling with the interest rates on existing bonds which goes hand in hand with lowering them and raising capital for acquisitions expanding production capacity
