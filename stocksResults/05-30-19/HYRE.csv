ChicagoMan,True,2019-05-30 14:05:00,3.9,HYRE Two quotes for the last earning calls So since the beginning of 2016 weve shown 13 consecutive quarters with doubledigit topline revenue growth and this quarter was no different We reported another record quarter in Q1 with revenues increasing to 35 million growth of 105 when compared to the same period last year We had 2900 new unique drivers were added in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 1700 new unique drivers added in the first quarter of 2018 Today in the six weeks since the last call the dealership numbers have grown to a total of 772 dealerships in the pipeline with 114 dealerships listing a car and over 1700 cars listed on the platform from an average of about 15 cars per dealership I give you these numbers because they represent a significant increase in cars listed per dealership and it gives some insight into dealer satisfaction because it implies legacy dealers are adding to their fleet inventory and sticking to the platform
ChicagoMan,,2019-05-30 12:55:00,3.9,HYRE this market maker is terrible if 8 people want to buy at 389 and only one person is selling at 396 why would drop the price to 389they paid by volume I guess
