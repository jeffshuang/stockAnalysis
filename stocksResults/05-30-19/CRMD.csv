soma_,True,2019-05-30 12:13:00,6.817,CRMD the longer this is able to hold the current floor and go sideways Ill probably start to raise the floor on my buy range from 546 to 6 timeframes should eventually pivot to work in the Bulls favor the ability to hold without news is encouraging Ill wait for that one puke Fest day have ambitious by orders already entered good luck
Nothing100percent,,2019-05-30 12:11:00,6.817,BIOC CRMD did the same thing in July of last year Look at the Wk timeframe Looks kinda similar Went from 120 to 1100 in 12 weeks This thing is going to make the real jump when its done wearing everyone out Im not in a rush Ill hold CRMD was dropping for years prior to that just like BIOC CRMD is still up over 300 from the July 2018 lows
Cooch111,,2019-05-30 12:00:00,6.83,CRMD If you were confident in the outcome of the FDA meeting wouldnt you keep buying more shares as Janet did Of course you would which is also why retail permabulls keep buying KHOSO and COOK however the two guys who know more than anyone dont appear to share the same sentiment Odd
RyGuy79,True,2019-05-30 11:54:00,6.8,CRMD One thing is for sure and that is the odds of NDA then FDA approval are growing exponentially larger before Khoso gives another lackluster earnings call
PULM,,2019-05-30 11:50:00,6.815,CRMD so the 1 and 2 share trades on this stock are very strange youd think theyd be less obvious with the manipulation i suppose it could be just 15 reverse split holders that had 100 shrs prior to the split and now only have 20 selling them off i guess

CramerShouldHaveListened,True,2019-05-30 09:40:00,6.776,CRMD WE ARE SO LPAD LPAD is the fastest and smartest way to get NDA approved FDA actually wants more companies to utilize LPAD pathway We will be number 2 for them Heres a quote from the last meeting with the FDA the FDA agreed that the company could request consideration of Neutrolin for approval under the LPAD Pathway For those of you who are not familiar with LPAD it stands for Limited Population Pathway for Antimicrobial and Antifungal Drugs We are very pleased about this outcome What this means for Neutrolin is that if the FDA agrees to grant LPAD status the FDA will have approaches for streamlined development and regulatory flexibility regarding the evidence required to support drug approval for patient populations with serious disease and limited or no treatment options while still meeting appropriate standards for safety and effectiveness including fewer or shorter clinical trials
doosty,False,2019-05-30 09:40:00,6.776,CRMD Averaging down is like making out with your sister Dont do it but if you do youre better off not telling anyone about it Wouldnt want people to get the wrong impression
