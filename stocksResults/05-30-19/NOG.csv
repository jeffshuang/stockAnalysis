chrome1254,True,2019-05-30 15:54:00,2.042,NOG Hahaha Oil aint for sissies I took a long 3 hour nap and watched an over 3 hour movie before that Gone with the Wind I checked oil first and it is getting killed so I expected sub 2 and I come here to see 206 Our bottom is here it cant do anything but go up Oil will not be this low very long and NOG will be 5 by the end of the year or higher It is time to get all you can it really is BOB
JRMF,,2019-05-30 15:47:00,2.045,NOG DNR So were probably seeing 55 oil tomorrow with bear attack on a Friday I would guess That means NOG at 196 or lower and DNR at 145 or lower Anyone agree or think otherwise I would love to hear rationale in order to make a better trading decision Thanks
JRMF,,2019-05-30 14:53:00,2.042,NOG DNR In just over a week oil has lost 7 Downright ridiculous I sure hope the Memorial Day draws next week are 7M or more and 5 in gas draws or I might sell out and call it quits in oil for a while
