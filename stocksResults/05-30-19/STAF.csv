friedrich_telecom,True,2019-05-30 12:05:00,1.63,STAF As I wrote before the 1 Cent DIV is a non event and so small that most retail investors can not even buy a small pizza from the Dividend Payment Maybe a small Signal to the market that hey we can pay a dividend we are out of the woodsbut low volume indicates that STAF just wasted some cash that would have stayed with company What we need more then tiny meaningless dividends is REAL updates from company showing progress Are we supposed to wait for just quarterly updates I am long and strong but frustrated with lack of tradable company updates
dogood,,2019-05-30 11:31:00,1.625,STAF when 165 breaks this will squeeze 178
