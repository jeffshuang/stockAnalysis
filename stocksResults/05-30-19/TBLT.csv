ZQN,,2019-05-30 11:25:00,0.6768,TBLT 1290665 series B warrants were executed between March 31 and May 24 this is based on the outstanding warrants at the end of Q1 the Hillair exchange and the outstanding warrants on the 24th Doubt any of those executed until the share price was below a dollar so looks like it took about a week and a half May 15 to 24 to clear out 1290665 shares Based on that it could take a couple weeks to execute the remaining 2191293 which gets us to June 7th TLDR there are probably still more warrants out there so dont expect much upward movement until midend of next week Happy to be wrong here though
Ensame,True,2019-05-30 11:17:00,0.6751,TBLT Ok this is the kind of volume I was waiting for and I like the signs of reversal accompanying in the short term Together with SSR I think we have a good recipe for good chances of a short bounce back I am in for a ride Bought at 068 Stop loss at 063 Good luck
