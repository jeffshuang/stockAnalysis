bwhipple,,2019-05-30 14:12:00,1.01,PULM A lot of what appears to be selling on the bid is intermarket maker trading done to generate false volume and the illusion that real selling is taking place Its shuffleshare trading and lot of it is symmetrical by share count

je0922,,2019-05-30 12:57:00,1.01,PULM Earnings historical have driven Pulm The 2018 drop from 193 to 52 was largely the result earnings expectations not being met Income for 2nd quarter 2019 will drive it up Add to the income the recruiting start of the trials and major rise in sp would be reasonably expected Set your sell points high and enjoy the next few months
rbpravin,,2019-05-30 12:37:00,1.01,PULM I have a feeling that the MMs will continue to let the share price hover around the 1 dollar range until this messy trade war is over Perhaps only then they have a chance of making the SP soar due to investor confidence without a backdrop of a trade war It is a period for silent accumulation Patience is the only way forward Anyways this is just my theory and nothing more

rbpravin,,2019-05-30 11:18:00,1.018,PULM There is this scene in Inglorious Basterds where ColHans Landa offers to help the allies in return for pardon and honor if he helps end the warHe says Sitting in your chair I would probably say the same thing and 999999 times out of 1000000 you would be correct But in the pages of history every once in a while Fate reaches out and extend its hand When is our date with destiny All inPlumgang

PULM,,2019-05-30 09:47:00,1.014,PULM IF this most recent 46 weeks of price action has been the accumulation phase of a wyckoff wave THEN well probably see a spring test of the 093c low made the end of april and IF that spring passes the test no more supply then well see this spring up to 125 and be in the markup phase where demand outstrips supply but were not there yet there is still way too much supply overhanging imo
