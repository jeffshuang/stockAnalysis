THEREALSIA,True,2019-05-30 13:39:00,0.779,INSY does not look very promising with no news and market so choppy I am keeping fingers crossed and will add if it goes up close to 1 at least i know it has a pulse But for now losing over 20k and hard to imagine this was trading around 11 couple of months ago and I didnt sell it Average price is around 950 and not sure if i ever see that again but hoping they can pull through all the crap is going on
