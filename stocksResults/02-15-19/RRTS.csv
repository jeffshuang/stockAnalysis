matty5,,2019-02-15 13:45:00,0.51,RRTS yeah I forgot about the small detail of the rights offering actually timing out whenever SP dips below 50
matty5,,2019-02-15 12:40:00,0.51,RRTS could institutions still benefit from exercising rights even if the market price we see doesnt appear so Quantity available
matty5,,2019-02-15 12:33:00,0.5099,RRTS I know they would certainly like some large institutional last minute buyers wrights other than Elliott
TheProfitElijah,,2019-02-15 11:23:00,0.509,RRTS Form T2 mil dump Also 2mil form t after hours rights dump Someone took their ball and went home
matty5,,2019-02-15 11:19:00,0.509,RRTS I only have dividend stock experience to go on The upside from 50 without news is hard to predict unless purely technical
TheProfitElijah,,2019-02-15 10:29:00,0.5151,RRTS who is buying on the market when they can buy all the rights they desire at 0001 and grab the shares at 50
reddheadsc,True,2019-02-15 10:21:00,0.5295,RRTS this should have support at least around 5556 imo
reddheadsc,True,2019-02-15 10:10:00,0.515,RRTS lets push this up a little
staytobasics,,2019-02-15 09:34:00,0.5151,When the RRTS rights offering ends how soon before theyre back in the sp 500 index And what happens to SP when index funds start buying
