value_search,,2019-02-15 15:12:00,9.99,CHFS 3 days no trading there is a retail with 1289 shares so eager to sell but he has moved price many times up and down Just sell it
value_search,,2019-02-15 13:49:00,9.787,CHFS with 513K OS and big portion of shares are locked with certain hard core owners Guess how the 100K can cover their shorts
value_search,,2019-02-15 13:48:00,9.787,CHFS another factor I have talked too often is short squeeze especially naked shorts See short interest amounted 100K in January
value_search,,2019-02-15 13:17:00,9.99,CHFS I think the only catalyst that will cause the huge hike and retail day traders chasing is on the day when offering priced at 30 or 60
value_search,,2019-02-15 13:14:00,9.99,CHFS Same happening at now low volume days silent acquirers are not getting the shares They gradually lift ceiling and eat in between

value_search,,2019-02-15 13:07:00,9.99,CHFS its still tutes accumulation phase Buyers are not retail Always good to see slow climb if for long investment
