Nathan_Klintworth,True,2019-02-15 12:55:00,17.988,FPAY RCII looks so out of the date Just like their brick and mortar stores Looks and feels like 1970s Hideous
Nathan_Klintworth,True,2019-02-15 11:59:00,17.97,FPAY is a target for being acquired Growing revenue and they have partners Its a good business model and makes RCII look dated
