zaxby99,True,2019-02-28 10:02:00,1.713,CRMD MMs will keep running this down so everyone bails Then BO or partnership skyrockets it to 25 and institutions reap all the rewards
the1truegamer,,2019-02-28 10:01:00,1.713,CRMD I think any higher value stock would be more predictable This being a penny with a good fortcast makes it prime for MM manipulation
