USAMolonLabe,True,2019-03-29 12:35:00,17.52,HTZ So it seems HTZ has a better growth rate vs LYFT You can pay 7 times less for HTZ and make a better return
Stealth_market_maker,,2019-03-29 12:11:00,17.474,HTZ I love shorting this stock first thing in the morning Then cover making that money
USAMolonLabe,True,2019-03-29 12:00:00,17.605,HTZ LYFT is now a 30B company and losing a 1B a year So it makes sense to buyout HTZ at 40 and well be happy Going higher
HCap,,2019-03-29 10:05:00,17.677,HTZ nice volume would like to see a push over 18
