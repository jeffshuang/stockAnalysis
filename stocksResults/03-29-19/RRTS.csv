matty5,,2019-03-29 15:05:00,0.4216,RRTS I only sell the cheapest approx 25 pct of my total shares when it happens Hold the rest
matty5,,2019-03-29 14:56:00,0.4216,RRTS by monster I mean over 25 pct
matty5,,2019-03-29 14:39:00,0.4201,RRTS I always buy it back and more The monster single day runs drop every time and do not change anything long term
matty5,,2019-03-29 14:38:00,0.4201,RRTS I see and understand the case for holding with no trading The occasional huge intraday runs are scanners and daytraders I sell some
matty5,,2019-03-29 12:29:00,0.423,RRTS very low volume
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:37:00,0.4271,RRTS But Ill reiterate that it is a show me story now on the margins We have to see some progress in order to extrapolate it to normal
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:37:00,0.4271,RRTS postsplit and if we pick up some additional sell side coverage the opportunity should become painfully clear to potential buyers
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:36:00,0.4271,RRTS Pre split it probably is not showing up on institutional screens and there is no incentive for additional sell side coverage yet
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:35:00,0.4271,RRTS In capital markets a mispricing can persist indefinitely if investors are not working on this and then act on their work by trading
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:33:00,0.4288,RRTS It is likely not lost on Elliott that this is a cyclical business overall I would fully expect that they have taken this into account
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:31:00,0.4242,RRTS Elliott is not a quarter to quarter shop theyre a fundamentally based activist investor
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:31:00,0.4242,RRTS This would just create an even better entry point Elliott would not be part of that group
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:31:00,0.4242,RRTS However a downturn remains the biggest risk as people thinking about pennies in this would likely blow out in a panic
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:30:00,0.4242,RRTS I would also expect Ascent to be less cyclical overall which could further cushion the other segments
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:29:00,0.4242,RRTS this is on a pure trucking trough multiple it ignores that in a sum of the parts the ascent segment is valued at a higher multiple
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:28:00,0.4276,RRTS 058 equity value on 5 in a DT
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:28:00,0.4276,RRTS If you think 6 is aggressive call it 5 still 100M EBITDA
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:27:00,0.4276,RRTS backout 150M in debt or so and you have equity value of 690M On 939M shares you have 73 stock price pre split
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:26:00,0.4276,RRTS If you slap a 7x trough multiple on that remember cyclical multiples are highest at the bottom youre looking at 840M EV
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:25:00,0.4245,RRTS If you assume a 13 decline in top line to 2B even but they are still able to get margins to 6 that is still 120M in EBITDA
RRTSBurner,,2019-03-29 11:25:00,0.4245,RRTS Guys to extend some of the comments about recessionary risk in my model I have assumed that they can still improve margins in a DT
