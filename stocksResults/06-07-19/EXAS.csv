Spiegel,,2019-06-07 13:31:00,107.026,SMSI I owned EXAS but during one if MasterCap live broadcasts when I asked him about it he took a dump all over the idea He praised SMSI to no end though So I sold all my EXAS and bought SMSI with the proceeds Terrible move Since then EXAS is up 15 and burst through resistance to new all time highs today And since then SMSI is down about 10 A 25 difference in performance Never feels good to sell a great winner for a piece of loser but thats what I did My own fault I assumed he knew more than I did Now Im a bagholder watching in pain as EXAS rockets to the moon Moral of the story never assume experts always know more than you
