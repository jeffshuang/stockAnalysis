ZenitramRC,,2019-06-07 10:23:00,4.083,CDXC Might go down just a smidge more before it breaks but its looking like it should make a move within two weeks Look at the MACD on the weekly about to cross negative which is why I see a possible slight dip or sideways move for it to cross negative You can see in the pattern it crosses negative for just a moment before it re crosses bullish and runs runs runs I love this chart gorgeous setup
