MicahW352,,2019-06-07 15:31:00,1.4,LPTX theres certainly some hedge fund here with their auto computers as I keep trying to place an order and it wont go through because immediately theres a order in front of mine I cancel and do it like 3 times same thing happens even if I bump the price Thats annoying especially with this volume
