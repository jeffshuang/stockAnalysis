wdewhirst1,True,2019-06-07 14:40:00,35.49,GM I like the chart Island reversal is a good indicator that this will go higher Going to keep a close an eye on news about Mexico tariffs
Bullrun1,,2019-06-07 13:49:00,35.4,GM only thing i can think of is the hope for a rate cut is mitigating the affect of tariffs on this stocks and others in the short term
Ro_Patel,,2019-06-07 13:33:00,35.389,If automakers absorbed the full cost of 25 Mexican tariffs the potential annual profit hit would be on 33B for F 63B for GM 48B for FCAU Passing the costs on to consumers would raise the price of vehicles roughly 2400 for GM 2200 for FCA and 1600 for Ford Tariffs could cut US vehicle sales by 3M as the industry already faces a moderate downturn US sales the past three years have been at a peak above 17M but in April were at an annual rate of about 165M A loss of 3M for a full year would cut sales about halfway to the Great Recession low point of 106M in 2009 In 2018 Mexico assembled 25M vehicles that were sold in the US Of those Mexican vehicles sold in the US 57 were domestic makes Trump also has threatened to impose 25 tariffs on vehicles imported from Europe and Japan contributing further to uncertainty in an industry that plans billions in investments in products and manufacturing years in advance Show More

Ro_Patel,,2019-06-07 11:13:00,35.454,In a letter signed by 17 auto companies warns Trump admin that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards threatens to cut their auto profits and produce untenable instability in a crucial manufacturing sector Trumps new rule which is expected to be made public this summer would all but eliminate the Obamaera auto pollution regulations essentially freezing mileage standards at about 37 miles per gallon for cars down from a target of 545 miles per gallon by 2025 The policy makes it a near certainty that California and 13 other states will sue the administration while continuing to enforce their own stricter rules in effect splitting the United States auto market in two For automakers a bifurcated market is their nightmare scenario In the letter to Mr Trump they warned of an extended period of litigation and instability should his plans be implemented GM F FCAU TM TSLAShow More
