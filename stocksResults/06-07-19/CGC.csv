auntimaryjane,,2019-06-07 13:26:00,42.167,CGC Its also worth mentioning that CBD edibles extracts and topicals will become legal in Canada no later than Oct 17 The legalization of those three product categories will introduce a plethora of new cannabis supply into the Canadian market which should be accompanied by a demand surge At the same time these products are known to have better margins than dried flower so cannabis producers like Canopy will get a margin and sales lift in the back half of 2019Consequently if you zoom out and look at the big picture at this point now looks like a really good time to buy CGC stock
ActorTrader,,2019-06-07 13:25:00,42.212,CGC Fully expect future volatility but very pleased with 1 the prospects of the Acreage deal and 2 Canopys global expansion plans There may be other companies in the space who will exceed the returns Acreage and Canopy bring but the management teams inspire a level of confidence in a volatile industry which I appreciate Acreage has already publicly noted that companies have been approaching them and I look forward to seeing whether future acquisitions take shape in numerous smaller deals for consumer products or individual licenseslocations or a larger acquisition to expand their national retail footprint WEEDCA YOLO HMMJCA
auntimaryjane,,2019-06-07 13:24:00,42.27,CGC This isnt the first trade war the US has been in and it wont be the last Looking at those other trade conflicts we can see that they dont stick around forever They usually get resolved within a few years or lessFurther supply shortages in Canada likewise wont last forever as Canopy is rapidly expanding its production to meet the countrys robust demand And lastly 11 states in the US have already legalized cannabis and it really is only a matter of time before CBD is legalized throughout the US

auntimaryjane,,2019-06-07 13:21:00,42.445,CGC Investors worry that trade conflicts could stall the global economy and stunt the expansion of the booming cannabis market These concerns are overstated Trade conflicts and tariffs are a near term phenomena Supply shortages and the FDAs hesitancy about legalizing CBD will also dissipate over the longer termIn the long run all these headwinds will reverse Thus when it comes to the cannabis market investors would be wise to focus on the forest instead of the trees When they do that they will see that the noncyclical growth outlook of the cannabis market remains as favorable as ever
