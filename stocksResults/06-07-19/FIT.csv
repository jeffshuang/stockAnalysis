fittwit,True,2019-06-07 13:18:00,4.41,FIT The reason why all of the growth from Versa is forgotten about isinstead of Mr Park trying to improve the bestselling smartwatch he removed features and priced the Versa lite to highwhich made the sales of the original Versa fall hard because it can no longer be discounted to 149 and compete with AW3 What will save us now is a new premium smartwatch and a successful paid subscription service which offers sleep apnea detection
