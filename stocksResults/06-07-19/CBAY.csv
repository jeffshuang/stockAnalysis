richard74,True,2019-06-07 10:05:00,10.385,CBAY If there was miss on the news say test data is off or a miss it would not be catastrophic as the prior tests are solid data at 10 mg
jeffs92,,2019-06-07 10:02:00,10.405,CBAY I think this attack on Cbay and intercept has to do with the FDA guidance regarding Nash with cirrhosis The short attack algorithms take news like this and drop stocks easily The FDA guidance has no relevance to cbays NASH market let alone their PBC market which analysts give them a 20 share estimate So its trading at 50 value for just PBC with no value for NASH or PSC

jeffs92,,2019-06-07 09:39:00,10.616,CBAY make no mistake this is a short attack The algos take news and just drop it down This has happened on at least 2 earnings reports where they missed estimates as if that matters for clinical bio The tradeable float is small with tutes owing 99 Algos know this and run with it
