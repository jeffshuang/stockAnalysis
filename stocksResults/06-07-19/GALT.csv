FailedFarmDog,True,2019-06-07 13:59:00,4.008,GALT I know I brought up the discussion of brokers a few weeks back and a few of you asked about USAA My primary brokerage I wanted provide a quick update I was just notified that my RO order did not get processed because they some broker did not put into the system before the expiration datetime apparently they just missed it even though I put my order in way in advance They forgot and then it was too late So first I have some nice bank to add these lovely cheapies to my account and saved a 35 order fee and second I am moving my money away from USAA Fortunately the other brokerage account I opened did get my RO shares processed so I am not totally out in the cold USAA great for insurance needs not so much for brokerage needs Lessoned learned GLA have a great weekend LONG

Tiggerrrr,,2019-06-07 10:11:00,3.994,GALT Guys please take it easy on the ICPT board they are becoming sensitive as the stock keeps dropping and threatening to ban us for freedom of speech BAHAHAHA Same way they expressed their opinions on our board we just did the same Except they keep tanking and only have a chance at F2 and F3 same stages as ALL THE OTHER NASH DRUGS wow definitely sounds like they have something proprietary NOT
Tiggerrrr,,2019-06-07 10:01:00,3.96,ICPT SMH I hate to see biotechs go down except ICPT They deserve it for their overwhelming ignorance and unwarranted hype You guys need a First Aid kit ASAP before you bleed out too much I can help PS look at who made the First Aid kit Richard U BAHAHAHAHAHA GALT

Scarliver,,2019-06-07 09:53:00,3.97,GALT Its not nice to kick a stock when its down Scripps Institute is one of the foremost centers in the world Im sure they knew the implications of their announcement and thought ten times before releasing it If they dont see an antifibrotic effect in ICPT something is amiss
rambogalaxyman,True,2019-06-07 09:46:00,3.894,GALT I would like to add another point Galectins previous day showing complications of cirrhosis could have included patients both placebo and drug arm that could have developed complications early on in treatment before a substantial effect could take place from the drug I think 2 year data will be compelling and select data from year 2 vs year 1 for the drug arm after therapy has had a chance to work somewhat may be even more compellingWe couldnt ask for more solid and relevant endpoints Complications are what matter mostThank you FDA Looks like the KOLs established these parameters with GALTs NASH CX data in mind and also probably to avoid biopsies As Scarliver has pointed out the KOLs essentially are in control here
Tiggerrrr,,2019-06-07 09:43:00,3.88,ICPT OUCHHHH remember me saying yesterday if this goes sub 80 say hello to 60s GUESS WHAT You are almost there ouch Tried to warn you guys but apparently you already know everything Tunnel vision is dangerous GALT
