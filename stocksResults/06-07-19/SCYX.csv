E_Coop,True,2019-06-07 12:46:00,1.16,SCYX To me fellow longs Over the past few years that Ive been in SCYX i have taken notice of how the stock performs when bottoming out reversing as i am seeing now IMO SCYX has a news event which brings in heavy volume and runs a bit The next few days the volume is typically a little more then the average 10day volume The price typically is up in the first hours of the day but then slowly settles down a few points above the open then trades sideways the remainder of the day This usually continues near term as it regains some traction Im am starting to see this pattern Having hit a bottom i think Wednesdays news price appreciation and volume spike is the event i am talking about Yesterday wasnt a Green Day but bullish it was We opened at 118 H of 119 L of 110 but closed up back at 116 Today were green with a H of 125 If i am correct the next few days should be like what today is shaping up to be Green w a nice high and close up a few points
