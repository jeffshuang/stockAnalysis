AUPHIE327,,2019-06-07 15:21:00,6.29,AUPH The day Peter Greenleaf announces Were going after the multibillion dollar DES market by conducting a Phase 23 trial starting next month because we believe we have the bestinclass drug thats when this stock starts to rise fast

AUPHIE327,,2019-06-07 14:53:00,6.3,AUPH DES is the key here all Its not only a fall back for LN it is the only thing that will move this price action about 750 from now until readout Novartis paid a premium for Xidra With VOS efficacy the large players are not going to want to wait to pay a premium Put some pressure on them and the offers will fly
pikus,True,2019-06-07 14:43:00,6.31,AUPH
Lunacy,True,2019-06-07 14:40:00,6.31,AUPH I find it confusing that people solely blame auph management for the price action They have made this a much more fundamentally sound company from where it was when all they had was a single indication midstage company They have made great strides to increase shareholder value For those that dont have a lot of clinical stage investing experience the market quite often doesnt react the way it shouldand the past 1218 months have been a prime example of thatWe should see a really nice runup this fall heading into PH3 readout Summers often get very slow as bigsmart takes time offbut I wouldnt dare be caught on the sidelines and miss a surprise announcement Im much more excited about the potential here now then I was at the PH2B readout Dont be one of those impatient investors that will have significant regret not waiting this out
jeff14,,2019-06-07 14:38:00,6.32,AUPH honestly if you vote green You are devaluing your own shares lol Giving control to a 14 owner Whats this company really worth then if that happens

jarepeo,True,2019-06-07 14:25:00,6.305,AUPH This stock has been run to make money for us on FDA approval Its the way it has been from day 1 The sp matters to us in terms of immediate convertibility but that is the extent of it The end is almost here and all these sub 10 sps will be moot No worries at all
IrritatedRhino,,2019-06-07 14:17:00,6.31,AUPH I am inclined to vote yellow Thoughts
james42349,,2019-06-07 14:06:00,6.305,AUPH Wake the f up you u long term holders Spewing optimistic words is what all companies do even when they got crap Look at price action and what management really do Spewing 45 a share a day like crazy ass NolamSpartacus wont do jack Im a long term shareholder with a pretty good amount invested and the last couple of years been shitty
JPatrick1,,2019-06-07 13:53:00,6.298,AUPH ILJIN considers increasing their ownership by acquiring more shares I think everyone should
1EyedSquirrel,,2019-06-07 13:52:00,6.3,AUPH why
PolarBear1,True,2019-06-07 13:51:00,6.29,AUPH The new CEO Peter Greenleaf there less than a month please give him a chance He said today at Jefferies conf that details for DES dev would be disclosed in the next month or two probably at the time of the next earnings last year 2nd quarter was released July 30th He already stated that the next trial Phase 23 would be underway before the end of the year Because this has BB potential they obviously want to make sure they get it right first time design patients primary secondary endpoints that its powered correctly to demonstrate statistical significance etc If the results are ve for the next trial know in 2020 I expect them to need to do one more trial pivotal Phase 3 trial prior to submitting the NDA for FDA approval likely in 2021 However I think that if the Phase 23 trial results are positive which is clearly what we would expect given the incredible results weve just seen market doesnt get it AUPH likely BO in 2020 Bullish
james42349,,2019-06-07 13:43:00,6.31,AUPH Why are all these fing management selling off their shares and Glickman abandoning a golden Goose im a worried shareholder and things need to change Stocks been doing shit compared to my other pharmaceutical investments They compared their stock with the SNP lmfao Actions speak louder than word Vote Green They need to be kept in check Largest shareholder ILJIN should be worried as any owner should
Iwillplay,True,2019-06-07 13:37:00,6.303,AUPH Should we b adding here
Neil_Armstrong,,2019-06-07 13:33:00,6.307,AUPH might nibble a bit more soon LordDragon asking my pigeons if its OK to feed them a lil less so that my bread expenses go down enough to buy some auphy
jarepeo,True,2019-06-07 13:33:00,6.307,AUPH I suggest voting Yellow Iljin protest was illtimed and illplanned They actually went into this thinking they could get a majority on the board They obviously cannot Then the share price thing It goes up and it goes down Towards the end of the year it will go up DES Management is still exploring options of which there are many The Phase2b3 is a big undertaking They are considering selling partnering going alone All have positive outcomes I totally understand the delay Existing BOD is terrific
james42349,,2019-06-07 13:31:00,6.305,AUPH Words are full of shit from the current management The actions in the past show just how shitty they are They sell off their own shares increase salaries and nothing has happened ILJIN is a worried shareholder just like anyone would
Mooch99,True,2019-06-07 13:31:00,6.305,AUPH Hope everyones doing well its mid2019 already

skiesthelimit64,,2019-06-07 13:27:00,6.305,AUPH Iljin and their Fing drama are killing this stock
james42349,,2019-06-07 13:26:00,6.305,AUPH I recommend voting Green The current managements actions dont align with shareholders interest They sell their shares off and also increase their salary with minimal equity stake Garbage stock performance and many shareholders reduced their equity stake in the past two years
skiesthelimit64,True,2019-06-07 13:25:00,6.305,AUPH Markets soaring and this is being shorted to death
pikus,True,2019-06-07 13:23:00,6.31,AUPH How was the presentation
PolarBear1,True,2019-06-07 13:22:00,6.305,AUPH Depends on Phase 3 AURORA resultsYes is does Look again at Phase 2 AURA data best ever by a long shot for an LN trial including Cellcept MMF which actually failed Phase 3 trials for LN but became the standard of care for LN anyway because it was so much better than anything else IMHO voclosporin is far superior than potential non oral drug Benlysta from GSK also being developed for LN So VERY BullishEXTREMELY
AUPHIE327,,2019-06-07 13:20:00,6.31,AUPH Can someone please help me understand the DES program and the delay in a phase 23 study Every conference they speak so highly of the secondary efficacy especially when you are comparing it to the current level of care Restasis Xidra Cequa etc we blew them all away I know we assume LN is going to go well but if it doesnt go as planned wouldnt you want a billion dollar a year drug ready to go in the pipeline to keep your value where it is at It took Auph 4 weeks to prove its dominance on the current standard of care Would it be that difficult to get this program started ASAP I would feel much more at ease with at least a little head wind going into Q4 Maybe Iljin wants the same thing Any input would be nice
JPatrick1,,2019-06-07 13:17:00,6.319,AUPH Way to finish the week I say we all head to a chat room get naked except for me Im shy and console each other Next week the price should drop low enough that we pick up some bargain price shares to replace that 15 ILJIN void and properly reclaim our company
amrose,True,2019-06-07 13:14:00,6.312,AUPH added some here I wish i kept BYND more and could add more to auph

younginvestor7,True,2019-06-07 13:09:00,6.3,AUPH will be adding more at this price
PolarBear1,True,2019-06-07 13:07:00,6.299,AUPH If AURORA results positive which is what I expect and we will know in 56 short months then AUPH is an aggressive strong BUY at anything below 10PS If it goes as I expect then single figures will be a thing of the past Add a potential new BB for dry eye and this will finally really take off We need to be a little more patient though61218 months of continued great results will have us acquired by BIG PHARMA for 3050PS range IMHOso continue to be VERYBULLISH VOTE YELLOW PROXIES TODAYVERY
Lunacy,True,2019-06-07 12:59:00,6.305,AUPH I thought Greenleaf did a nice job with a strong presence and knowledge of the company Voc just 30 days into his new position Details for Vos most likely announced at Q2 ERHit on key areas for proxy vote without name calling or pointing fingers imoClear and concise plan for moving forward

ehpats,,2019-06-07 12:41:00,6.32,AUPH I cant make much sense of whats happened here over the past week Most everything has a perfectly reasonable explanation but not this time I can only assume I dont have all the information I need to make an informed decision therefore Im cautiously sticking with auph management and keeping my fingers crossed We will most likely get the whole story right after its too late to do anything about it

flyhigh7,True,2019-06-07 12:01:00,6.36,AUPH needles noise from ILJINthey should have given Greenleaf sometime to set direction Timing seems very deliberate to me Reaching for more power I dont think there is any other way to interpret this timing Yellow
flyhigh7,True,2019-06-07 11:52:00,6.34,AUPH I find myself turning more yellow every day AUPH is red
StockTrader21,,2019-06-07 11:46:00,6.347,AUPH I wonder if AUPH was a Cambridge MA or Bay Area biotech vs Canada its share price would be in the 1012 range

UT_RPh,,2019-06-07 10:54:00,6.39,AUPH is down about 5 since ILJIN letter
paperjam,,2019-06-07 10:51:00,6.392,AUPH ILJINS MOTIVES ARE UNCLEAR if its a real motif based on major deficiencies or events we may never get to know itif its just a show to make waves given the form because of some minor objections it worked all eyes are now on theboard winwin for all of us Thanks go to ILJIN

SteveTexans,True,2019-06-07 10:28:00,6.32,AUPH What I want to hear today from Greenleaf concise strategy plan laid out going forward with VOS Right now it is clear as mud other than Ph23 trial in 4qtr too general If any updates on VOC and FSGS Convince more tutes to buy drive up stock price Improve messaging Too much money on sidelines We get to hear is sales pitch first time Hoping for the best Increase shareholders value 1 CEO responsibility increase stock price learn in business school

skiesthelimit64,,2019-06-07 10:25:00,6.32,AUPH I see Iljin is bringing it down steady
Lunacy,,2019-06-07 10:20:00,6.35,AUPH Well done Aurinia team ILJIN if you have an issue with shareholder value and price actionwhy dont you bring a solution to the table rather than just pointing fingers
johntall,True,2019-06-07 10:14:00,6.35,AUPH If Iljin attacks they will be like the kid sitting on the sidewalk hitting himself on the head with a stick A concerned passerby stopped and asked him why he was hitting himself and he said Because it feels so good when I quitThey lost and cannot turn their mess into a win by making it worse
HowdoIGRAPH,True,2019-06-07 10:07:00,6.37,AUPH the funny part tho ILJIN can control price action with very low volume look for this to keep dropping even on good news Dumb move for them though
itsgonnahappen,True,2019-06-07 09:59:00,6.397,AUPH Does Glickman retiring have anything to do with this
Mattastic75,,2019-06-07 09:56:00,6.401,AUPH If true that ILJINs motives are to take control of the company its such a desperate lowodds move I wonder if well see a 13D noting further accumulation on their part in coming months Im so curious to know their calculusIt just seems dumb on the surface which leads me to believe their full motive is yet unknown Would love to be a fly on the wall at ILJIN HQ
johntall,True,2019-06-07 09:48:00,6.403,AUPH As more information surfaces the collective consensus of this board is proving to have been extremely accurate With nobody on the inside and nothing but eyes on screens we seem to have nailed itCheers all
