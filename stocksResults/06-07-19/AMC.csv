NeverEverQuit,True,2019-06-07 15:34:00,10.785,AMC Pathetic price action is all I can say about this Way too oversold at this point Hopefully a sustainable rebound will start soon
McRib,True,2019-06-07 15:21:00,10.775,AMC has about 443 million left in their original 100 million share repurchase program If AMC does not repurchase shares at this level which unfortunately we will not know until the next 10Q then it is a reason to jump shipCNK seems to have been the better dividend play here faring better than AMC with the same pressures of the box office We will see but Im not holding this to find out what the bottom looks like If the board does not think that this stock price is dirt cheap right now neither will I
