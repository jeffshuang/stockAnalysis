EquilibriumEconomics,,2019-06-07 10:02:00,0.224,HUSA petrol prices go up in summer in general because Since 1990 under the Clean Air Act the Environmental Protection Agency EPA has required the use of reformulated gasoline blends during April through September in major metropolitan cities This fuel costs more to produce so it leads to higher gas prices during the summer months The EPA has estimated the impact to be 2 to 4 cents per gallon The reformulated fuel sold during the summer months doesnt provide purchasers with the same mileage as winter blends Therefore more fuel has to be purchased to drive the same miles This increase in quantity of fuel purchased also leads to higher prevailing market prices In addition HUSA hopefully will complete fracking within a week or so leading to good pr boosting the price further
