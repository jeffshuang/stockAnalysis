Pharmclin,True,2019-06-07 09:57:00,1.625,TTOO there have been several negative mentions of Mr Market whoever she is Unless Mr or Ms Market has completed medical school or is an Infectious Disease Specialist or a ER or ICU Nurse or an acutecare Clinical Pharmacist or an Epidemiologist I would not place much credence on Mr or Ms Market TTOO is a fabulous diagnostic device and is endorsed by four hospitals in my county Need to note that Healthcare Purchasing Agents are just that Purchasing Agents they are not decision makers The decision makers are the medical and clinical staff and the purchasing agents respond to their demands No hospital administrator or CFO in their right mind would deny the purchase of a life saving diagnostic item Every product needs an effective sales force and the task of TTOO is to deploy an experienced sales staff with healthcare experience and that is taking place right now Sit tight with TTOO ignore the shorts This clinically focused acute care HCP expects TTOO to skyrocket
