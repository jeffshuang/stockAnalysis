ITM_Monte,,2019-06-07 15:39:00,9.476,I remember I happened to be at CZR during a Pacquiao fight and nearly all the tables were 500 1000 plus
bobsizzla,,2019-06-07 15:36:00,9.476,CZR Sorry to hear tlu starry eyed dreamers arent getting anywhere close to your fantasy price of 1400 what will likely happen now is that Icahn wont sell and will instead decide to direct Rodio to do what he does and start laying people off and closing properties and getting this thing in shape for a sale sometime in the future But no quick buck for the specuLator Lol

GoingGreen,,2019-06-07 13:31:00,9.587,CZR Im thinking FOMO should be a big factor in driving the price up this afternoon
shootinseven,,2019-06-07 13:28:00,9.575,CZR didnt Fertitta offer 13 a share a half year ago whats with this 1050 I keep hearing about Vegas is expecting to have a huge 2020 with project completions in the city Id rather not merge with ERI A bunch of Reno and other lackluster destination casinos is not going to cut it
TheMonk,True,2019-06-07 13:10:00,9.63,CZR I intend to hold on to my shares I bought in the 8s I want to get full value out of this or close to it If they rejected 1050 and Eldorado is back again that means they sweetened it or one can infer that Of course the 1050 was a rumor so do your own DD Always do your own DD I like it here and will not sell at 1050 either I owned the old Mirage Corporation when MGM took it over and the first offer was so low They came up quit a bit at the time to make the deal
leakyjuan,True,2019-06-07 12:46:00,9.614,CZR day traders are weasels
TheMonk,True,2019-06-07 12:37:00,9.601,CZR We all are reading the same articles and we can see the rumor had it they rejected 1050 a while back My opinion and it is just that 1050 is way too cheap I do not think they would take anything under 12 but we shall see
joniva,,2019-06-07 12:32:00,9.59,CZR Sold out my weekly position Gonna get back in if it hits 860s agian
StockBrokeGuru,,2019-06-07 12:29:00,9.59,CZR sometimes i hate investing you hit 960 then immediately people sell like fuck sometimes i just want a win
JackSplat,,2019-06-07 12:19:00,9.58,CZR WTF this cant get thru 960
RuhRoh,,2019-06-07 12:14:00,9.599,CZR As I said many times before the first offer will not be the final selling price Other buyers are waiting for an offer to be accepted before counter offering The key is the break up penalty If small expect another offer I would expect it to sell for at least 52wk high as this is not a fire sale but consolidation play
