SoundsAwesome,,2019-06-07 15:17:00,22.089,LABD XBI Added at 2203
SoundsAwesome,,2019-06-07 14:32:00,22.26,LABD XBI Will you look at that low volume algo pump Take a look at the 5 min chart and tell me you see real strength in this move Will be adding small amount of LABD at EOD I smell a 8309 high with LABD around 2201
DanMoonC,,2019-06-07 13:42:00,22.271,LABD if LABD 18 LABU needs to be 52 Maybe another 2 weeks if upside trajectory continues at same pace XBILABU still have lots of resistance between here and there
ZenTrader_xyz,,2019-06-07 13:12:00,22.558,LABD 18 would be a good place to enter
nickoftime,True,2019-06-07 12:51:00,22.43,LABD If I wasnt loaded with TVIX id be buying this here down to 21
DanMoonC,,2019-06-07 12:36:00,22.489,LABD 2250 here but wait it went lower So maybe low 22 is worth the wait Gotta to see if LABU can break 43
calibre,,2019-06-07 10:45:00,23.222,LABD sidelines for me fow now This could go either way here over next couple of wksPowell pump on afterburners
ntbd618,False,2019-06-07 10:27:00,23.843,LABU since this sucks added some LABD
quanmunist,,2019-06-07 10:14:00,23.751,LABD no matter who wins next year this is going up
SoundsAwesome,,2019-06-07 10:10:00,23.604,LABD XBI Hahaha bizarro world we live in Bad jobs data equals good news for stocks This was expected though but Scaps again not participating much Lets see how the day ends
DanMoonC,,2019-06-07 09:53:00,23.47,LABD Missed the opportunity at 23 to scalp thinking it could go do 2250 it just reverses and zoom towards to 2350 Lol this baby moves fast
DanMoonC,,2019-06-07 09:39:00,22.967,LABD Waiting for a bid at 22502260 area or maybe wait till LABU gets to 42504275 again for reentry
