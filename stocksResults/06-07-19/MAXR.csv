SpaceGuy65,,2019-06-07 15:54:00,6.141,MAXR ok time for one last small push up before close Not a huge day but at least a step in the right direction again
coldtoez,True,2019-06-07 15:19:00,6.155,MAXR Launch is coming June 12th I think that is the catalyst we need

JBinTal,,2019-06-07 14:47:00,6.21,MAXR Per the Donald the moon project is only part of the larger Mars Mission Maxars current contract is just the beginningVia twitter from Trump For all of the money we are spending NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon We did that 50 years ago They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing including Mars of which the Moon is a part Defense and Science
SpaceGuy65,,2019-06-07 14:37:00,6.205,MAXR Launch got pushed by a day to June 12 715 amObviously nothing would get finalized buyout partial sale etc before the RCM sats are successfully in orbit Why take that risk So by the end of next week we could see some movement
Susu_Rafraf,,2019-06-07 14:31:00,6.239,ZIXI showing up and the chart looks the same as MAXR I got stopped out of MAXR yesterday then it popped 6 today so I was pissed about that

Mr_Anderson007,,2019-06-07 13:49:00,6.266,MAXR I will be royally piED to see a buyout on this stock The true value on a possible turnaround will be far far greater than any buyout IMO Itll be a situation as once again where shareholders get the shaft Another risk is MAXR issuing shares to reduce debt load which of course would dilute existing shareholders Current debt loads as indicated in the previous quarterly conference were considered optimal for the stock So a stock issue at these levels would be theftfull stop If we have the ability to stay the course then who cares about institutions clamoring on about debt levels I dont think they were clamoring on about debt levels when the stock was at lower revenues and slapping US 60 price targets on the stock CAD 80 Ifwhen institutions are convinced of a turnaround theyll be paying a multiple of current share priceall other things being equal

Mr_Anderson007,,2019-06-07 13:24:00,6.29,MAXR Finding support at lower trendline originating from March Breaking downward trendline from recent highs Bulls will hopefully take the reigns moving into Q2 results pushing back and breaking to new highs Maxar needs to deliver some goods cost savings expected to be realized Who wants to be short going into Q2 Seasonally better quarter some wins already in pocket Will be interesting Action going into Q2 will be telling

AlTajnai,True,2019-06-07 13:01:00,6.25,MAXR I love how when MAXR is down all the bears come out but when its up the bulls take the W Reals Gs work in silence like lasagne
EspElement,,2019-06-07 12:47:00,6.23,MAXR Now has a ton of places of resistance to get back up I suspect it will be a slow slow climb back up at this point Still has risk of dropping for sure
MagGyver,,2019-06-07 12:46:00,6.23,MAXR Id like to see Maxar pitch adding modules similar to the PPE as a method of dealing with the additional mass Would quadruple the present value of the recent NASA contract
