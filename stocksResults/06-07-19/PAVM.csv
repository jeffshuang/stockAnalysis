Maineman5,,2019-06-07 15:29:00,1.1,PAVM Agree with BobChill below With a little patience I think there are so many great ideas that are almost to market I think we will be looking back in a year with a big multibagger on our hands I have been loading up the Z warrants PAVMZ with a 160 strike price and exp date of April 2024 as I can buy 3 times the number of warrants as shares today Say I get taken out at 9 which the company can do subject to certain conditions and notification I can still buy about 80 of the number of warrants as common shares assumes 9 price at redemption less the 160 strike price The temporary headwind I see now is funding which will hopefully be addressed with a sale partnership of one of their other products which could be very soon

BobChill,,2019-06-07 12:12:00,1.098,PAVM I think were all guilty of getting distracted with details that dont matter here The conversion being the latest talking point Even if it is a net negative does it matter in the event of device clearance Not imho The bull thesis hasnt wavered even a millimeter in the last year that Ive been here The only play really worth making is holding through device clearance I have no idea what SP will be after that but one thing Im 100 sure of its going to be higher than 109 MUCH higher is my guess
sohaibjan,,2019-06-07 10:10:00,1.1,PAVM are they going to really dilute
jmatbob,True,2019-06-07 10:10:00,1.1,PAVM You know that debt conversion is actually very bullish It does offer an investor a way out But why would pavm be willing to do so Pavm is looking for cash not decrease debt to hurt SP with dilution The investors would not have sold upon conversion
