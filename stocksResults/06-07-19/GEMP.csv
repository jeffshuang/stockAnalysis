lookg,True,2019-06-07 13:56:00,0.849,GEMP I could go on with many reasons but one is look at Gillians Great background and he and his VC own a boatload The CSO inventor also owns a boatload If this case if you have good news stay silent keep your powder dry and wait for the right time Keep in mind if you have great results no need to tip off ESPR and othersGlass is half full argument but i think the glass is more than halffull We shall find out
