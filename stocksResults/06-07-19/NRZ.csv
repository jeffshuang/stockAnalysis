ironwill21,True,2019-06-07 15:38:00,15.158,NRZ before you panic sell and give me more shares for a discount think about this If you buy 250 shares here at 1517 you spend 379250 You get 500 a year in dividends Now lets say you dont reinvest them I think you should In 10 years you have 5000 in dividends on a 379250 investment even if the stock does nothing and the dividends stays the same That beats the SP 500 annualized return of 10 over those 10 years patience

goti123,,2019-06-07 12:03:00,15.081,NRZ From CEO Nierenberg May 1st2019 My comments are bracketedMSR buys in Q2 Post Q1 we bought about 25 billion of MSRs for our MSR business NierenbergThese MSR buys were in Q1 and Q2 Ongoing Now that Powell ph and the Fed came out and basically said theyre on hold Weve actually put out on a bunch of hedges against the MSR in the mortgage space One thing I want to point out as we put on more mortgage hedge against our MSR the core earnings will go up because youre buying mortgage assets against your MSR NierenbergQ2 ongoing to the extent we remain in this low vol environment and we add more mortgage hedges which we are and will be doing down the road that will lead to higher core earnings Nierenberg
goti123,,2019-06-07 11:58:00,15.105,NRZ NRZ is actively buying MSRs purchased 25B UPB this Q so far With these MSR buys they are also buying Agency Bonds to hedge out any devaluation of their MSR buys Their purchased Bond portfolio is at a 20 discount to Par What do you think is going to happen to those bonds with a declining rate environment Theyre going to go up offsetting the losses in their MSR book Uninformed weak hands are selling because they simply dont understand the complexities of NRZs business
