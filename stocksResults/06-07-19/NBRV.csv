Boyce18,,2019-06-07 14:59:00,1.985,NBRV Not surprised No real news from the presentation yesterday This will only spike when we have an official statement that the issues with Contepo are addressed or if the FDA approves Lefamulin in August If

HeyU2001,,2019-06-07 11:41:00,2.06,NBRV I have been positive the entire time and I dont want to be negative but want to bring something up from the Dog and Pony show They said the 2 drugs will be launched in Q1 2020 they pushed everything out 4 to 6 months but we only have enough money The have a 75 million credit facility that they have drawn down25 million already That means they have 50 million available upon certain milestones The big question is will they have to dilute and raise capital or more to the point will the cap any great run with an offering Most management will raise when the opportunity is available So my fear is we get a run up into the PDUFA and the approval of C and the run up gets capped by a dilution Worse case scenario is we get a CRL for L and we get tanked then we move up on C approval and they dilute at lower prices than above Any thoughts
