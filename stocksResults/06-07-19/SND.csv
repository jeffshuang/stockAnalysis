BitcoinBear,,2019-06-07 11:15:00,2.828,SND CVIA you would be absolutely nuts to stay in this If you like sand you would pair trade into HCLP and let them all revert back to the mean If sand is going up HCLP is going to seriously out perform HCLP will also outperform if sand continues to plummet at least in the longlong run but HCLP could still underperform today So you need a horizon longer than just today
