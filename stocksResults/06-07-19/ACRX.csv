cornelyu,False,2019-06-07 14:11:00,2.321,TRVN people are going to learn the hard way ACRX got approved and their still licking their wounds trying to hold 2 Morphine is king in this space Everyone waiting for fda approval like thats supposed to mean something Many stocks are out there with market cap in the 100s of millions WITHOUT FDA APPROVAL No demand means no sales this is where the story ends am i right ACRX
BakedChicken,,2019-06-07 13:52:00,2.321,ACRX looks to go into the 220s by EOD then we could float around 215 200 for a while if we get that low if it does Institutional investors will begin further reducing exposure and company will have no choice but dilute further to keep operating way too long before the next ER If Vince has a rabbit in his hat or a dove up his sleeve now is the time to wow the kids all just my opinion

biotechnology,,2019-06-07 12:16:00,2.335,ACRX Ive been a champion of Vince But its time to admit that his missteps are going to ruin this stock 1 He raised too soon after the approval 2 He deprioritized Zal 3 He failed to get EU partnership 4 He kept his Q updates to minimum 5 He assumed too much risk in this antiopioid era by not considering bo or some other transaction in the US 6 He underestimated the capital and time needed to sell a pain drug to the hospitals 7 In spite of being a DoD sales rep in the past he failed go secure early wins with large federal customers like DoD and VA Also he gets paid too much
DeadMoney80,True,2019-06-07 12:06:00,2.335,ACRX I havent seen much discussion on production costs Does anyone have a good read whether they are hitting targets Cost of inventory
biotechnology,,2019-06-07 12:05:00,2.33,ACRX Theres nothing Vince can do that will increase the SP The ONLY thing that matters is the sales Vince is in a catch22 He doesnt have enough resources to ramp up the sales and without decent sales he cannot have the resources to expand

betterthanmutualfunds,,2019-06-07 10:02:00,2.4,ACRX a lot of people trying to convince everyone that everything is going great While reality is they are just selling you their shares Dont worry they will buy them back from you when it tanks and hits your stop loss
