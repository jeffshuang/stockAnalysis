CaptainFancyPantz,True,2019-06-07 10:56:00,5.25,CALA heres the way I see iton February 4 2019 the Entrata trial commenced with management stating results expected in second half of 2019fast forward to May 9 2019 just 3 months later management states Entrata readout midyear 2019 IMHO either the data is fantastic and theyve bumped up the release date to share OR the trial is going poorly and will be stopped If the data was anywhere in the middle I dont see the reasoning they would move up the readout date If the trial was going poorly why would they release early unless Novartis is calling the shots Well see what happens but at this point midyear means any day
