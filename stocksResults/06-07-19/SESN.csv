superstamp,True,2019-06-07 09:56:00,2.18,SESN We are down to a single day of trading before an announcement from the company giving the details of the preBLA meeting yesterday So one little thread left in the rope holding this bull back Anyone believe the Monday morning meeting wont contain good news Its all been good lately No reason to think it wont be good even great on Monday This announcement of news came very quickly My money is very long here but I think were about to see this run My guess is we will hear a timeframe for the BLA filing and IMHO I think it will be sooner than previously expected
