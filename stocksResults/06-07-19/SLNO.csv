bluemooncapital,True,2019-06-07 11:15:00,2.563,SLNO the days range inherently shows that there is no one selling A high was set of 271 but all they do is set a bid as low as 258 on 16 thousand shares they drop it 20 cents There is a black box imho When you see this sort of manipulation know something good is going on behind the scenes Watch for slingshot effect soon with possible 200 upside short term
