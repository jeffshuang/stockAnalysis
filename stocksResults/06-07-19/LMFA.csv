Scargs,True,2019-06-07 12:29:00,1.295,LMFA Pretty clear about whats happening here Craven are going to takeover LMFA and wont have finished buying yet It also explains why this shareholders meeting has been cancelled twice and no sign of being rearranged as yet despite what they told me about announcing the date in the near future a month ago You can bet Pajak has told Rogers to either hold off on the meeting or just forget about it whilst he continues to gather shares on the cheap as opposed to 241
