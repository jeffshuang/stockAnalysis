Ro_Patel,,2019-06-07 15:39:00,38.057,The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 21 for the IRS over Altera which is currently an INTC subsidiary The court had issued a similar decision last year but heard the case again bc one of the judges Stephen Reinhardt passed away before the determination was issued the author notes Based on past disclosures billions of dollars of federal tax revenue could be at stake The case involves what is known as sharebased compensation and where it should be deducted as a business expense The IRS wrote a regulation that required companies to deduct more of it abroad as opposed to deducting it in the US Especially before the recent tax law companies had an incentive to claim those deductions against the higher US tax rate Many companies including GOOGL FB TWTR EA have cited the outcome of the Altera case as a risk in their financial statements
