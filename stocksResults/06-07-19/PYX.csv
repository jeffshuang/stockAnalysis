TheTwitOlympics,True,2019-06-07 13:44:00,18.22,PYX Will we not always have a large short position with so much institutional ownership I thought institutions hedge their large positions by purchasing put options So as the stock price rises wont they buy more higher strike put options I think there will not be as big a short squeeze as the large short percentage indicates due to the large institutional ownership

Slvrsk8r,True,2019-06-07 13:10:00,18.217,PYX Perfect conditions for that squeeze to come next week 25 million shares short in total vs 9 million total float with only 3 million public float Recent low volume accumulation may signal stronger hands particularly with the volatility here Plus there is heavy open interest in June calls at 20 and 225 with little open interest in puts which makes sense since this looks to have bottomed recently in 16s Catalyst coming soon with ER likely next week Just waiting on PYX to officially announce ER date Hoping to double my 40k after we get some new revenue growth reported coupled with optimistic future guidance which should be fairly expected given new markets they have recently entered Shorts better hurry to close positions before this gaps up on just an okay ER We dont need much buying pressure to trigger a squeeze under these conditions Recent tobacco earnings also show strength see UVV so this could be an absolutely monstrous short squeeze a la Tilray
