IrishGreen,,2019-06-07 14:01:00,0.925,FPAY The bad thing here is that this stock is broken not the company but the stock I think it will take the August earning release to move this up and when it does it will be great Im still thinking this will shoot up to the 2 3 range If it hits investors scanners and the news is particularly good 4 or more
IrishGreen,True,2019-06-07 13:58:00,0.925,FPAY Im thinking this might slowly move up to 1 in the next week or so Unfortunately unless theres a huge catalyst like another great earnings which I expect this wont move up much Im seriously thinking this might not move up very much for several more weeks At that point it will start hitting investors scanners and then then it will fly
