StrangerThings,,2019-06-07 12:12:00,43.885,WDC STX WDC management is ineffective and wont let their employees do their job Management gets rid of good employees and keeps bad ones Management also blew it on the streaming media player market and the cloud market They let ROKU take over the media player market even though WDC was there first to bring the media player to market Now they are trying to navigate through the Sandisk merger and cant seem to get any traction on anything Employees have low moral as well They thought the Sandisk merger would save them but doesnt seem so now If companys stock goes below 33 they will be looking at BK in my opinion
