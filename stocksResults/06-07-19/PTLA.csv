Grtgooglymoogly,,2019-06-07 14:19:00,26.77,PTLA omg A touch of green Just frickin frustrating and disappointing Meanwhile Beyond Meat is up 35 percent Hard to swallow literally and figuratively Still patient but just SIGN A DEAL
eriklarsen,,2019-06-07 11:27:00,26.263,PTLA My bull thesis Not one to call for 100 SP but we have to take a step back Is the company worth more than 19 b market cap Sure there is uncertainty to how fast A is being adopted sure there is Trump beating the drum about drug prices but with Europe coming on board and more data coming out with C which is not priced in all all how can this not be a buying opportunity some 25 off recent highs

willwallace,True,2019-06-07 10:02:00,26.267,PTLA every trade above 1000 shares was a buy and almost all from the DF exchange which is typically institutional somebody wants in
willwallace,True,2019-06-07 09:54:00,26.3,PTLA almost every downtick is on trade below 100 shares and often below 10 shares and still fewer than 100k shares total pure bs
