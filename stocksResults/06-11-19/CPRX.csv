uniowner,,2019-06-11 15:00:00,3.442,CPRX I think management may be waiting for the first official Prescription for an adult to be filled by Jacobus Off label to file suit That will be proof that their Orphan status granted for adults for LEMS patients for that compound is being infringed upon Stay tuned
w1nt3rmut3d,True,2019-06-11 14:52:00,3.443,CPRX Fck PR This is what mgt should be doing by default when shareholders face confidence issues You step up and BUY
EternalHope,,2019-06-11 14:38:00,3.42,CPRX more insiders will be purchasing as they always follow but it also means no new big news on the horizon because that would be insider trading on any news
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-11 14:31:00,3.43,CPRX I would like to think the email I sent to Catalyst earlier this morning prompted that buy

Investbythenumbers,True,2019-06-11 14:15:00,3.471,CPRX Based on the link below it appears the CEO bought today Why today Because he MUST HAVE concluded what I posted earlier Jacobus will have no material effect on Firdapse sales BUY BUY BUY Now is the time to buy not after the Company gives the investors the all clear sign

LongFTW,True,2019-06-11 14:05:00,3.4,CPRX I was worried Jacobus were going to price it at 100k to really undercut CPRX but they priced it at 292k a year lolll very affordable now to all those who dont have insurance sarcasm
Investbythenumbers,True,2019-06-11 12:32:00,3.315,CPRX All it will take now is for CPRX management to provide a full year estimate and simply state that they do not believe that Jacobus will have any material effect on their projections and 6 will be the price in seconds I would not want to be short this company now
LongFTW,True,2019-06-11 12:02:00,3.235,CPRX Bernie really helping out all those people who cant afford it now lol where is the outrage of Jacobus that used to give the drug for free is now charging 292K a year for a childrens medicine They want to profit off sick children in need
dkmadhvn,,2019-06-11 11:57:00,3.237,CPRX MMs should move against the shortstill then snooze
keremoner,,2019-06-11 10:56:00,3.285,CPRX Any lawyers here Wouldnt a doctor or an insurance company be liable if they routed me from Firdapse to Ruzurgi despite the fact that the FDA never approved Ruzurgi for adults If the answer is yes then Catalyst will not be losing any revenue other than what is attributable to the known 11 pediatric patients On the other hand many of us longs are using logic here and markets are irrational That is why I am worried that we will not see the 6 level again until we have a couple quarters of results that are positive
arang,,2019-06-11 10:50:00,3.265,CPRX This stock has been heading South little by little with repeating process of Open EOD Down AH Move up little bit Repeat
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-11 10:42:00,3.245,CPRX MMs went down looking for sellers and didnt find many Maybe upward
LongFTW,True,2019-06-11 10:31:00,3.259,CPRX Jacobus charging 292K for Kids medicine Why are they profiting off kids illness lol waiting for the CNN report not going to hold my breath
cantwinemalll,,2019-06-11 10:31:00,3.259,CPRX can anyone clarify Will insurance even cover off label use of Jacobuss drug I mean if its only approved for kids right would insurance pay for it if prescribed off label to an adult Im clearly ignorant on a lot of this
keithh1989,True,2019-06-11 10:29:00,3.255,AMD ppl doubted you in 2016 I held i did sell in 2017 I wish I hadnt but hey 75 gains isnt bad now were looking for that 40 target price Check out PRPO CPRX interesting pharms that also have strong investors and management STRONGSTOCKS2019
LongFTW,True,2019-06-11 10:29:00,3.255,CPRX Jacobus now selling it for 292K a year but they were giving it away for free How dare they oh wait thats how the US health care system works especially with low patient or else why would someone spend millions to get it FDA approved and to marketHope Bernie comes out and attacks them for this outrageous price Sarcasm
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-11 10:15:00,3.215,CPRX Not to mention why would an insurance company authorize reimbursement for offlabel use when the costs are relatively similar I dont believe they will
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-11 10:11:00,3.24,CPRX Dosing for any of these treatments is based on the patients weight and disease severity Catalysts Firdapse which is approved with a maximum dose of 80 mg carries an average list price of 375000 a yearThe list price for Ruzurgi is 80 for each 10 mg tablet and Jacobus treatment is approved up to a maximum dose of 100 mg Laura Jacobus told Endpoints News As an example the wholesale cost for a 60 mg dosing regimen would be 17520000 annually The cost to support a patient requiring a daily dose of 100 mg would be 29200000 annuallySo to compare with Firdapse an 80 mg cost of Ruzurgi would be 233600 100K less than Firdapse but worth going offlabel for Nope
arang,,2019-06-11 09:51:00,3.324,CPRX So far it seems like Stats is the only source of that pricing
BigJuicy,True,2019-06-11 09:51:00,3.324,CPRX
dkmadhvn,,2019-06-11 09:34:00,3.298,CPRX IMO Its up from here SP will come down only if jacobus captures more than 30 catalysts of paying customers again IMO
