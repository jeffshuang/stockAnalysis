nuthinbutbandz,,2019-06-11 12:03:00,3.58,MEET puckfan so apparently my comment regarding why this isnt growing got deleted so i decided to make you a post the answer is quite simple market manipulation someone out there is holding this back probably a mm of some sort allowing shorts to gain a stronger attackattachment why they are doing this who knows why meet is allowing this who knows is this legal who knows every time this stock beats its earnings which its been doing for the past 2 years it gets absolutely hammered and to make things worse meet management refuses to address this issue we will see this upcoming earnings report if the same thing happens then the SEC needs to get involved because this stock should be trading easily in the 1012 range without all the short manipulation
