Scarliver,,2019-06-11 15:12:00,3.64,GALT The question looms How many people will die in NASH and cancer for Pharma greed Articles such as The Galectin Signature in cancer demand that GR2 be advanced Yet it languishes both in cancer and in NASH Pharma stall tactics Pharma greed In NASH this should have commenced in combo with a metabolic agent long ago Its not all management fault here Plenty of greed to go around
Scarliver,,2019-06-11 15:06:00,3.64,GALT Big Day tomorrow International NASH day NASH webinar being conducted by American Liver Foundation I am partial to GALT but no single drug will make this epidemic go away We need combination therapies Sadly certain companies are continuing combos with drugs that dont work Placing profits in front of patients GR2 is a perfect drug for combo therapy

D_Coral,True,2019-06-11 13:02:00,3.59,GALT remember this chart Looks like there was a crash from 12 and then what 714 gain And the thing is GALT is a much stronger clinical asset
VolumeBot,,2019-06-11 12:53:00,3.585,Short volume percent for GALT was 595 on 061019 an increase of 903 from 060719 volumebotcomsGALT
Danny180,,2019-06-11 12:41:00,3.595,GALT Galectin PhIIb NASH trial fails the primary goal
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-11 12:37:00,3.59,GALT RSI at around 1149 am today was at 1096 That means it was BEYONNNNNNNNNND oversold SSR in effect but that doesnt mean scalpers arent selling Now it leveled out Explains the random drop I am buying few hundred more today for the hell of it I am a greedy Tiger what can I say GL
D_Coral,True,2019-06-11 12:34:00,3.59,GALT this happened to some very good tech companies toward the end of last year Some of those lost half their value while GALT held up decent considering the market crash Now this week biotechs are getting hammered in general across the board GNFT is down 14 just today This is the time to buy and accumulate and average down Be greedy when others are fearful This stock can jump higher multiply suddenly with the next press release or potential licensing deal etc
Danny180,,2019-06-11 12:34:00,3.59,GALT crash pos Ill cover my short 2
kylesimpleton,,2019-06-11 12:24:00,3.595,GALT Dont miss this buying opportunity you may not get another one until tomorrow at 275

D_Coral,True,2019-06-11 11:56:00,3.599,GALT This is a 40 100 stock long term or much sooner with a realistic possibility for MA Whether the price is 3 or 5 right now is not going to determine the enormous attention this stock is going to receive when GALT is the ONLY company with an antifibrotic in Phase 3 NASH This price action is only of concern to short term traders
rambogalaxyman,True,2019-06-11 11:56:00,3.599,GALT its buy time

ap20,,2019-06-11 11:40:00,3.68,GALT This investing alongside Mr U is working out about as good as buying a ticket on a Boeing 737Max fight with a suicide leaning pilot
AVOR,True,2019-06-11 11:14:00,3.69,GALT Portal hypertension is crucial in the development of ascites since the occurrence of ascites is rare in patients with a wedged hepatic venous portal gradient of 12mm Hg It may very well that the FDA could approve HVPG and progressionfree from varices as two coprimary endpoints as composite endpoint for treatment of Compensated cirrhosis Stay tuned
rambogalaxyman,True,2019-06-11 11:09:00,3.7,GALT is in a great position to prevent decompensation events in its phase 3 Take a look at the graph below Data should be even stronger at 2 years since these events are seemingly random and could happen early in the study For year 2 data patients would not have had a decompensation event before being on the drug for a substantial amount of time GALT is in great shape
Scarliver,,2019-06-11 11:07:00,3.696,GALT The stupid chopped liver who thinks he is so smart is not so smart You cant use a study on compensated Cirrhosis that includes alcoholics who continue to drink and apply it to NASH Cirrhosis where the exclusion criteria on entry drinking alcohol is clearly stated And yes I confess I blocked you on one device my hand held but still can see you when I look at my PC You think you understand liver disease but your understanding is rudimentary
ryans1984,,2019-06-11 11:06:00,3.696,GALT when is the bottom dollar coming keep lowering average just to see the price drop more Might is wait to buy more after it hits under 2 There is better chance for 2 instead of 5 with this crap
LAKEMARY,True,2019-06-11 11:04:00,3.696,GALT perhaps maybe management might have something to say anything
kylesimpleton,,2019-06-11 10:55:00,3.689,GALT Blah hahahahahaScarliver thinks the company needs to read StockTwits to help with trial design
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-11 10:54:00,3.69,GALT GILD The need to make up for lost sources of revenue and stimulate growth may encourage future MA GILD is trying to enter the NASH space and had some not so pretty results HMMMMMMM giddy up
ChoppedLiver1,,2019-06-11 10:54:00,3.69,GALT The cowardly Scarliver who has me blocked yet still reads my posts accuses me of flat out lies about compensated cirrhosis patients not being at risk of death because they arent very sick That of course is incorrect as this study of 1830 patients who potentially had cirrhosis 729 of which were diagnosed with cirrhosis indicates226 of the upcoming GALT population 12 out of 53 died within a median follow up time of 47 months 1131My point is that these events are random and outside of the control of the Ph3 trialthe variance in the original population will have an impact on the eventual outcome and makes it very different than the original GALT release about Ph3 that focused only on progression to varices and HPVG reductions both of which were tested in the Ph2 CX trialThe pumping on this forum has just become a joke along with the fanboys who claim anyone with another viewpoint is a short I own shares bought into the RO but am realistic periodShow More
Scarliver,,2019-06-11 10:42:00,3.703,GALT Hey GALT insiders and CRO Do a smart thing on this trial Measure a 24 hour urine creatinine clearance on entry and then do it again years 1 and 2 Liver and kidney function are interrelated You can obtain important information on GR2 effects on kidney function with this simple noncostly 24 hour urine test Kidney decompensation in the setting of liver disease is known as Hepatorenal syndrome Major issue in decompensated disease I hope someone takes notice of this post
StopaGE,False,2019-06-11 10:36:00,3.708,GALT Still managing to drop with the SSR in effect Total joke
kylesimpleton,,2019-06-11 10:36:00,3.708,GALT within the last several weeks NO 0 articles on GALT have appeared in ANY prominent journals GALT fanboys think they are they companys PR dept and sadly maybe GALT does too Thats how GALT is different than other biotechs they dont need experts or pier reviewed articles that give unbiased facts They have SA and StockTwits experts to distorted facts and pretend that any and all articles on Galectin 3 are really about GALT and their great progress over the last year and a half
Scarliver,,2019-06-11 10:15:00,3.731,GALT And within the last several weeks exciting articles on Alzheimers and AML in the most prominent journals GALT investors think for themselves Thats how we are different than you Bossman And we dont resort to lies like chopped liver who totally distorted the trial entry points for his agenda Even the FDA guidance stated it was for compensated disease Not for very sick patients who could die at any moment
D_Coral,True,2019-06-11 10:13:00,3.735,GALT Another reason the latest FDA guidance is very favorable for GALT Galectin3 inhibition has therapeutic effects on MANY inflammatory fibrotic disease processes A NASH patient death can occur for reasons secondary to the liver problems Consider that Galectin3 inhibition is being studied for myocardial infarction heart attacks diabetes etc We should see increased overall survival in the GRMD02 arms for multiple reasons in addition to reducing occurrence of varices The latest guidance goes back to the basics prevent the varices and NASH complications treat the whole patient keep them alive and well This is something that looks very good in the Phase 2 data GALT will be in their MA crosshairs of big pharma and Im sure already is Who knows what Back Bay is still working on
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-11 10:03:00,3.743,GALT in particular look at NUMBERS 22 27 30 on that list Thank you and goodbye
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-11 10:02:00,3.75,GALT Number of publications 3776 in which a specific disease was identified and galectins were mentioned in association with the disease ARE AS FOLLOW1 Thyroid carcinoma 2 Colonrectalgastric cancer3 Heart failuremyocardial dysfunction4 Breast cancer5 Papillary thyroid carcinoma 6 Pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma7 Melanoma 8 Rheumatoid arthritis 9 Orallaryngeal squamous cell 10 Prostate cancer11 Diabetes 12 Gliomaassociated cancerglioblastoma 13 Preeclampsia 14 Follicular thyroid adenomascarcinomas15 Ovarian cancer 16 Crohns disease 17 Hepatocellular carcinoma 18 Asthmalung inflammation19 Pituitary tumors adenocarcinoma20 Spinal cord injury21 Bladder cancer 22 Liver fibrosis 23 Lung cancernonsmall cell lung cancer 24 Renal carcinoma 25 Myelogeneous leukemia26 Ischemia 27 NASH 28 Headneck cancer29 Esophageal cancer 30 Liver cirrhosisFYI there are 126 diseases ICPT who has limited application again DDShow More
Scarliver,,2019-06-11 09:52:00,3.75,GALT You want to resort to flat out lies about very sick people dying at any time Thats decompensated disease The trial is in compensated Cirrhosis to prevent tip over to end stage where they are very sick people that can die at any time You are a flat out liar and will stop at nothing including lies to discredit this company
Scarliver,,2019-06-11 09:47:00,3.757,GALT Compensated cirrhotics are not very sick people They can live 12 years or more without any issues just humming along until a decompensated event occurs Someone here is lying
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-11 09:46:00,3.749,GALT Galectin targeting is in the very early stages and there is as yet no convincing evidence of efficacy in a human disease The pharmaceutical industry likes proven targets and once there is evidence of an effect in human disease activity will increase THIS MEANS BIG MONEY WILL GET IN
ChoppedLiver1,,2019-06-11 09:43:00,3.749,GALT Anyone who believes the garbage posted here about the new FDA guidelines making acceptance easier rather than more difficult is in for a rude awakening The GALT press release in May 2018 about the initial FDA meeting clearly identified two primary endpoints HPVG reduction and lack of progression to varices both of which were met by the Ph2 nonvarices population The new guidelines eliminate the HPVG endpoint while adding others as clinical outcomes some of which occurred in the Ph2 The biggest issue is that GALT has no control over the population of each treatment arm these are very sick people and any of them could die at any time regardless of the cause and it will be a negative in the trial if its one of the GR patients There is no way to determine how the trial will be handle all of this until the protocol is announced and analyzed thats one reason the stock is down investorgalectintherapeuti
