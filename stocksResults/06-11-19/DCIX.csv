doogie06,,2019-06-11 15:39:00,0.9095,DCIX Given the financial position of DCIX getting a bank line with a favorable rate is highly probable They only need 40MM if they use 10MM of their cash Given that they can liquidate and have over 100MM they are in great shape They can put the 2 new boats plus one other ship up for collateral and their LTV is 50 for those 3 and there would still be 3 ships free and clear I still wish they would have liquidated for 225 per share but this is a roll of the dice that profitability plus an upward movement in shipping rates and ship values will bring more than that Palios is banking 10MM on that fact In fact if he liquidates the company in a year he doubles his money I also like that this is a straightforward deal I bought 30K shares today at a 15 discount from Palios shares

LordWatzmann,,2019-06-11 14:59:00,0.9007,DCIX The madness of these old men is that the share is struggling to stay above the 1USD mark and they are diluting again with 10 million new shares How stupid is that Even the 5 million selfservice shares are a case for the authorities
dogood,,2019-06-11 13:44:00,0.919,DCIX I cant believe that this is red dont know have they started buyback or will they do

BulIishTrade,True,2019-06-11 11:57:00,0.893,GLBS good luck to whoevers holding through earnings today Ran 100 last time on earnings beat so will be interesting to see if shipper momentum is put back in play tomorrow thats if earnings are positive Shippers extremely cheap at these levels TOPS DCIX SHIP NM all due for another rally imho
doogie06,,2019-06-11 11:57:00,0.893,DCIX One other positive I see from this Palios is looking to make from the shares he acquired in this transaction He is expecting well above 105 in return
LordWatzmann,,2019-06-11 11:57:00,0.893,DCIX The sales obviously over Ship prices not only tankers are apparently increasing We remember The 4 container ships of Perf Shipp are in the books to the scrap value A further price collapse seems therefore unlikely rather the opposite is to be assumed
LordWatzmann,,2019-06-11 11:50:00,0.9,DCIX for interested users splash247comdianashippin The tankships has been bougth from Maersk
doogie06,,2019-06-11 11:47:00,0.901,DCIX Looks like we are acquiring Maersk Jeddah and Maersk Jamnagar Oh the ironies for this boardI was hoping for a liquidation However Palios effectively bought 10MM shares for 105 Company is on the hook for another 50MM Assume they use 15 MM cash they need to finance 35MM Balance sheet would have 2MM cash 4 containerships worth 60MM assume oil tankers worth 60MM purchase price less 35MM debtShares are 37MM assume dilution of preferred shares and some inevitable options pushes us close to 40MM Liquidation value is still 2 Now IF they can show nice profitability from those ships net of financing costs we will be looking good
dogood,,2019-06-11 11:29:00,0.9,DCIX 25 months on sideline to get this dump But IMO one good thing is couple of months ago 2 investment group invested on it and now CEO is investing as shares not sure what does it mean

dogood,,2019-06-11 10:20:00,0.9641,DCIX with this transaction they might cancel the buyback they wont have enough money to do buyback
Phlippy,,2019-06-11 10:09:00,0.99,DCIX ok my understanding Please correct me if Im wrong They are buying 2 tankers for 60M They are paying for 10M of it with stock at a purchase price of 105 And the rest of the balance they pay with cash and financing Sounds right
Convest000,,2019-06-11 10:07:00,0.9727,DCIX not sure why this is down but I havent looked into what the preferred shares rights are The 10M funded by CEO paid in common isnt a bad thing He couldnt diluted ATM or via 3rd party
dogood,,2019-06-11 10:05:00,0.9858,DCIX It is not dilution read this affiliated with CEO Symeon Palios for an aggregate purchase price of 10 million which will be paid in common shares at a per share price of 105 Basically CEO owns they are paying to him
