tuannguyen,,2019-06-11 13:28:00,2.613,EXPR The company need to cut cost and clean house now before it is too late Show to the market that you can return to making profit every quarter not just only the 4th quarter The current cash burning rate per quarter is unacceptable at all The business operation is not stable at all
tuannguyen,,2019-06-11 13:21:00,2.615,EXPR At the current cash burn rate in a year from now they will be in deep hole and start to borrow money assuming no improvement and no cleaning house The problem with these retail companies they wait until the last minute to clean house Watch and see
tuannguyen,,2019-06-11 13:11:00,2.619,EXPR FYI for the past few days I get into their earning reports to see how they used their cash Oh man what a horrible surprise to find out and no wonder why the stock went down so much They used part of cash to buy stock like 20 but 80 they used for the business Like last quarter they used 5m for stock buy back and the rest 18m for business This is very bad because they drain so much for each quarter and at the current rate they will not survive for long Now the only 4th quarter is the one that they can generate more cash and for the rest of quarter they drain cash at least 27m for each quarter
