Facts1,True,2019-06-11 09:50:00,2.858,TXMD I am surprised that when Finizio is in New York he couldnt manage the favorable analysts better Dumb but maybe he wants to tamper expectations as he knows this company is never being sold for 20 a share or even 15 He and we will be happy to double our money again here Still an awesome buy at these prices
fnu2,,2019-06-11 09:49:00,2.874,TXMD i think Imvexxy Bijuvia and Annovera should be in Amazon man stock will skyrocket like how NBY did yesterday
Facts1,,2019-06-11 09:45:00,2.875,TXMD Finizio said he would buy stock and he probably will He is sly He made sure not to pump it before his money is in So buy it now and youll get his price Believe me he will pump it more after his cash is in further This stock is completely manipulated and it can fall and rise on a dime just because someone wants to play it The presentation yesterday was complete crap and I knew less than half way through that it was another play I can wait a year at 307 avg and make money on the swings Fortunately Amazon Apple and the Tesla we liked at 186 are giving us extra money to play with

Facts1,,2019-06-11 09:37:00,2.915,TXMD Here we go again Dump and recover Dump and recover You dont have to be a short here to make money trading You just wait for the end of each little wash out and then in and back up Its so far a very predictable cycle here It would better if there was momentum but I can wait for that Rob will sell this company for around 9 as soon as he gets the chance Just bringing up the income and products to put it into a sale eventually Thats what he does Thats his rep and thats why people give him the cash
00retPA,False,2019-06-11 09:34:00,2.892,TXMD where are all the analyst upgrade idiots today they must be on the moon where they said SP would be on ER day
