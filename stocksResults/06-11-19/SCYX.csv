TheEsquire,,2019-06-11 15:27:00,1.095,SCYX Im beginning to think as I see these stocks that have 300 to 400 runs off of no catalyst is just mms and big money pick a bitch for the day and pump and dump it and if you can get 20 well you were lucky But most get caught holding bags as they come in too late
TheEsquire,,2019-06-11 15:23:00,1.09,SCYX so Heb does a rs which in other stocks Ive held people dump and run to the hills but no it has a great climb today And we had great news a number of times and we just gradually go down

bigmoneynate,,2019-06-11 10:42:00,1.12,SCYX this is not going anywhere until one of the catalyst dates so theres not much sense in hoping itll be much different until perhaps June 30 when Phase 3 data will be released
