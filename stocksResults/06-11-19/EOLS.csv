Sectorseer,True,2019-06-11 14:26:00,13.373,EOLS Hope someone from main street got in at these levels Big money brought this down with that fake overweight rating and pt from Barclays Someone was paid off to bring this down temporarily so they could buy in big If you got shaken out I genuinely feel bad for you Its the type of trading Big Money Makers on Wall St do all the time to get you to unload your shares See this is rebounding already on the same day a new pt was issued at 13 If you cant see the sucker at the table its you Dont get played by Big Money Manipulation And never never trade based on emotions This stock is the only one on my watch list that is down My watchlist are the only stocks I own They were all manipulated deeply during the course of owning them Ive owned Amazon since 2005 Netlfix since 2010 Im telling you Evolus is a winner But of course anyone can be wrong Ive been many times but they way I see this being manipulated tells me its going to be gigantic

junebug67,True,2019-06-11 13:47:00,13.26,EOLS mostly men here it seems I am a 51 year old EX user of Oldtox I dont care what product I use as long as it works and yes price point I am excited that newtox works faster and hopefully last longer I used Dysport and found it didnt work for me This is not kleenex actually how many of us actually purchase Kleenex brand these days not many or qtips i have no problem buying other brands even generic tissue like Target brand AGN has had a monopoly on this product due to the toxin These products used to be for the rich and famous not anymore I dont know any women my peers that arent using neurotoxins and yes fillers Woman are really are using these products at a younger age because it keeps old lady wrinkles away Women will never stop being vain Women talk we share information I know silly womens intuition here just saying Allergan is a creepy company anyway I would rather support another business
Fearless_Contrarian,,2019-06-11 13:35:00,13.042,EOLS EU approval delayed
Sectorseer,True,2019-06-11 13:30:00,13.013,EOLS This is artificially being kept at these super discount prices 13 is bottom Weve proven that over and over again This is a huge buy at these levels
jeana,,2019-06-11 13:00:00,13.107,EOLS Any thoughts on June 19th conference That is next Wed Hang on til then What if they announce positive Eur resolution as a surprise
APJFinancials,,2019-06-11 12:55:00,13.052,EOLS Weve seen the bottom here a ton of potential to double in price within a couple months
Stone52,,2019-06-11 12:55:00,13.052,EOLS short sale restriction still in effect When they return over the next day or two this will be epic
Stone52,,2019-06-11 12:43:00,13.008,EOLS where did the pumpers go who have been bashing me relentlessly for the past 30 days
OptimalGeek,True,2019-06-11 12:38:00,12.947,EOLS looks like it will end up bouncing back up might close Green

StockBank,,2019-06-11 12:22:00,12.848,EOLS wow is everyone getting scared
RiskBiz,,2019-06-11 12:12:00,13.018,EOLS As someone very deep in cosmetic industry I find some of the comments made by the CEO very misleading If the quarterly revenue is less than 10M investors should question him for 3000 practices comment I can also see Allergan having more than sufficient tools to destroy this competition if they want to I love watching this stock as I am learning how stock price is manipulated and how investors are cheated because I can clearly see what is happening on the street with practices I know the real pricing I know the very high overhead the company is enduring and what management of EOLS is reflecting is not the honest picture
RiskBiz,,2019-06-11 12:12:00,13.018,EOLS They hired many reps and managers from Allergan including their CEO with very high salaries of course That gave them a clear advantage of targeting the right practices There are many practices in US that are hammered by big Allergan accounts because big practices get many rebates discounts and free products with Allergan Partner Privileges APP program And EOLS straight away targeted these practices and managed to give 5 or more free products to 3000 accounts BTW Botox is sold in 23000 practices in US One big disadvantage they have is they do not have any fillers like Allergans Juvederm line And while Neurotoxin biz is growing the real growth is in fillers More in my next post
Stone52,,2019-06-11 12:11:00,13.01,EOLS total and complete JUNK

Sectorseer,True,2019-06-11 11:47:00,13.185,EOLS Im going out a huge limb that this will be back at 1925 before July 4th Quote me on that
SirJefferson,True,2019-06-11 11:32:00,13.246,EOLS Botox Injections 25 OFF Botox Discounts advertised Barclays Downgrades EOLS PT to 13 What happened to other EOLS Analysts w 31 PT Looks like the bottom was in under 13 and this POS can only go higher At this price Allergen could just take this dog out and shoot it behind the barn Might be cheaper for AGN
RowShamBo,,2019-06-11 11:29:00,13.207,EOLS whyd I think itd be a good idea to get back in on this Greed got me
sktrader1,,2019-06-11 11:20:00,13.16,EOLS 13 price pt makes me question if any of these analysts ever even went to business school There is no way this trades sideways for an entire year Will be over 30 or essentially zero if lose ITC Given shares outstanding and current mkt cap it is an absolute joke to even come to that price So they expect it to not lose in ITC but have tiny sales for the entire year Like incredibly tiny given current market cap I post less because this is lame no matter what you believe It is a big reason I pay less and less attn here When they are done manipulating it will climb and we got major catalyst that can make it explode in the MT I still believe this bet comes down to ITC If you are playing the ST game here good luck I still feel I get the last laugh here

Sectorseer,True,2019-06-11 11:03:00,13.131,EOLS Strong support at 13 Guaranteed the Barclays rating was another manipulation attempt by the big boys Someone that sold huge positions and now wants back in at super low prices Not many shares in float Soon this stock will have a huge demand
Sectorseer,True,2019-06-11 10:50:00,12.81,EOLS Weve a super low float These market makers are really greedy to pick up your shares cheap Dont let them steal your shares This is a huge sign that we will get big buyers coming in at these prices

CheeseCityBeerMan,True,2019-06-11 10:29:00,12.947,EOLS Avg down or look away today bullsfundamentally nothing here has changed but were under the control of both shorts and speculation This isnt going to get better until EU approval is finalized and Q2 data is released We have faced a whirlwind of bad macroeconomic situations hit piece press and poorly timed setbacks
Coldfriction,,2019-06-11 10:28:00,12.957,EOLS Theres too much downward pressure here Barclays gave it a price target of 13 That means 13 a year from now The fact that it is under that today is crazy when the last time the price was this low they had no approved product to sell and the market overall was in freefall Shorts dont have much more to gain here and a lot of risk imo Longs have significantly less risk here than shorts There are far less risky things to short right now and far more risky things to long

OptimalGeek,False,2019-06-11 09:44:00,13.537,EOLS 1323 is your saving grace if it breaks support will see 1277 lol
DolanFinancial,,2019-06-11 09:40:00,13.318,EOLS as everyone knows Ive been a giant bull here for a long time Long term EOLS will be strong but theres too much negative sentiment right now that were likely to see further drops until we get order and sales data Trade safe this breaking under 13 support could be a drastic wash down to 11
