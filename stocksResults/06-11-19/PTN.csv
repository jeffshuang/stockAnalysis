10fold0413,,2019-06-11 15:31:00,1.271,PTN whats going on with this stock Are insiders buying or selling
Plumb4trades,True,2019-06-11 15:29:00,1.276,PTN many have the narrow focus on the short term downtrend but take a step back and you will see we are still maintaining the overall uptrend starting back in February This should have been an expected pull back Everything makes sense when you step back and look at it PTN showed enormous potential with such a strong run up especially Mays 510 cent a day gain MMs and their big buyers took note and drove this price down to load up The timing is all a perfect orchestration IMOWe look to be entering our bounce off the trend line Today looks like a flat day but Im expecting a slow crawl up in the following days and a quicker run up next week
Detuma,,2019-06-11 15:23:00,1.275,PTN This is happening every single day since two weeks Someone is definitely going out but tries to keep the price at that level The only reason I can think of is an accumulated short attack But whos confident enough to do that Why should it go down after the approval Are we missing something Does someone have any hypothesis on this kind of move
ChartMill,,2019-06-11 15:17:00,1.28,PTN has an average volume of 2167190 This is a good sign as it is always nice to have a liquid stock chartmillcomanalyzephpu

Slowgallop,,2019-06-11 15:02:00,1.28,PTN To commentators re my post regarding the PT141 warning In contrast to that warning Vyleesi if approved will be safe sterile with calibrated dosages and subject to stringent FDA standards Which would you want to use
Slowgallop,True,2019-06-11 14:52:00,1.289,PTN In answer to a number of comments In contrast to the warning on PT141 Vyleesi is subject to stringent FDA regulations procedures and control in respect to the drugs chemical integrity sterility testing efficacy adverse reactionsrisks production dosage keep in mind the dosage amount is controlled by the injector and access should it be approved Which of these two drugs would you want your significant other or yourself to take
V2018,,2019-06-11 14:45:00,1.29,PTN insiders are buying lot of shares lowes and Selling them around 140
V2018,,2019-06-11 14:43:00,1.29,PTN its a scam insiders huge scam they wanted to keep this under control until get FDA Approvals
Slowgallop,,2019-06-11 14:33:00,1.289,PTN In short in contrast to PT 141 Vyleesi is subject to very stringent FDA standards that govern its chemical integrity dosage sterility production distribution acquisition and application to assure maximum safety and minimum risk to the public should it be approved Which would you want you or spousesignificant other to take
JamJam99,True,2019-06-11 14:28:00,1.287,PTN looking for along time bio investor to answer here Will we found out on Sunday if the approval has went through or when the market open on Monday the 24th Also is the review process common on Sunday seems kinda odd to me
MrWarthog,True,2019-06-11 14:26:00,1.29,CRMD Im out Taking my dollars to SESN and PTN Cheers to you all and good luck in the long run
RubberJ,,2019-06-11 14:16:00,1.285,PTN wow 7m shares are lend to sell short Not saying they sold short just that the number which was available has dropped with 7m So someone is preparing for a drop on failure of fda or prepare for a huge spike and sell short there
Slowgallop,,2019-06-11 14:14:00,1.28,PTN xgin asks Other than your drug Vyleesi being injectable how is it different from this drug Are they not both bremelanotide PT 141 Answer from PT141 site regarding PT141 WARNING This product is a very potent chemical This product is NOT for human use and can be harmful if ingested This product is for researchlaboratory use only This product is NOT in a sterile solution and is NOT to be injected This product should only be handled by licensed qualified professionals This product is not a drug food or cosmetic and should not be misbranded misused or mislabeled as a drug food or cosmetic Enhanced Peptides 2018

Slowgallop,,2019-06-11 12:30:00,1.28,PTN Excerpt from the PT141 site Difference between PT141 and Melanotan 2 Melanotan 2 was licensedto pursue the erectile dysfunction application MT2 proved to have more pigmentation qualities than it did for ED however it led to the development of a derivative PT 141 also known as Bremelanotide PT141 is slightly chemically different than MT2 PT 141 has a hydroxyl group where Melanotan II has an amide group Compared to other erectile dysfunction medications Bremelanotide is unique in that it doesnt work on the vascular system This means its potential application may apply to both males and females Note the distinction as a result of the two different chemical groups hydroxyl and amide MT2 proved to have more pigmentation qualities than it did for ED It is notable that ADRs for Vyleesi do not include pigmentation related effects Also PT141 is available only for research purposes not OTC consumer consumption Ref enhancedpeptidescomproduc
qwerty_89,,2019-06-11 12:27:00,1.286,PTN To all longs investors my recommendation is dont sell on approval once approved PTN never gonna see 130 again This is a game changer for PTN multimillion license deals all over the world revenue and huge BO candidate My price target for the next 6 month is 8 conservative estimate which is a market cap around 16b For a drug which could create a revenue around 35b in the next 10 years only in the US when the average market share is around 10 This will be huge and all over the news if approved
Zippy510,,2019-06-11 12:26:00,1.29,PTN You are deadlocked between 125 and 131 Posted a while ago you get a flag again till decision on drugAt least the manipulation and associated churning is over for you allNow onto actual value Hope for all involved you get an approval if not will be ugly times ahead for PTN
