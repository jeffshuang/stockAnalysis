LexusDriver,True,2019-06-11 14:16:00,1.22,VSTM ZFGNWhen you have ongoing never ending daily heavy volume of the share price trading back and forth looking like someone is accumulating you likely have the algo bots just scalping their tenth of a cent on those round trades Its a very powerful disintegration of a stocks price as the hedge funds make big money in the billions on this type of trading The institutionalretail investor has no control over this but to buy and hold until they release their algorithms on the playYouve witness this daily runup then a slow bleed down no matter the news or fundamentals Could they bankrupt a company yes as the company has a harder time getting access to money in the open market at a lower share price But if the fundamentals are true they will cover in mass and thats what youre looking forward to for high gains Problem is waiting out a mindless machine stealing your hard earned money and that is what they pray on the waiting game The longer the wait the bigger the move

KeepRollin,True,2019-06-11 13:15:00,1.219,VSTM Shut your eyes till the end of the month This is stress for no reason You see when big companies cannot profit by taking price up they take it down and then take it back up to make money With Insti knowing that most of you own shares for 5 or more they are playing with it It is understood that real sales wont happen till they 2nd half of th year It should recover to 3 plus soon At the end of the Institutions have to make money so they will drive it back up
