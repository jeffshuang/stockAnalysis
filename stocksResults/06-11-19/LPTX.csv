Radcon2017,True,2019-06-11 10:04:00,1.397,LPTX Status Quo appears to be changing to a Bullish SentimentThe one thing that will really change sentiment will be Strong Data followed by Business Development Update How Leap will continue in 2020 either Bought Out Partnered Up Or FinancedI would expect hope to get clarity on all 3 by Q3Q4 at the latest in my opinion With the Raymond James Presentation coming up I would think they would elaborate at the Shareholders Meeting as to what new Data could be presented at this conferenceAnyone going to or listening to the Shareholders Meeting
