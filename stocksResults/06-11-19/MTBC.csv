nibbons,True,2019-06-11 13:15:00,4.6,MTBC seems theyre taking their sweet time with the next acquisition better be a good one bc those preferred are racking up in the meantime
moonbear,True,2019-06-11 13:10:00,4.6,MTBC has been on an upward trend since the start of 2019 Looks like its taking a breather now and consolidating but thats just my opinion No stock goes up in a straight line Recent support around 450 Have a great summer my fellow longs
TrendsRFriends,,2019-06-11 12:45:00,4.59,MTBC The main reason I decided to sell this stock is because investors just dont seem to care about this company So whether the company makes 50 million or 500 million in revenue doesnt seem to matter because for whatever reason this company isnt a company that investors are interested in hence a share price that never goes up Thats why I finally sold
