DetroitDaveOptionsPlayer,True,2019-06-11 12:55:00,66.635,TNDM SignalsOnly positive signals in the chart today Tandem Diabetes Care holds buy signals from both short and longterm moving averages In addition there is a general buy signal from the relation between the two signals where the shortterm average is above the longterm average On corrections down there will be some support from the lines at 7008 and 6512 A break down below any of these levels will issue sell signals A buy signal was issued from a pivot bottom point on Thursday May 23 2019 which indicates further gains until a new top pivot has been found Volume is rising along with the price This is considered to be a good technical signal

DetroitDaveOptionsPlayer,True,2019-06-11 12:23:00,66.446,TNDM I am absolutely not an expert when it comes to Short Interest but from what I read please correct me if I have it wrong if the Short Interest is going down its appears to be an indicator of a reversal of trend As I studied the double top at the end of Feb early March it coincides with the highest Short Interest Conversely on 418 TNDM was at 5441 there was a huge decrease from the 315 highest Short Interest I have not seen the 5302019 updated Short Interest yet but I think they probably update it by 615 I am curious to see if the Short Interest continues to decline Does anyone here follow the Short Interest and use it as an indicator of Bullish or Bearish trends

DetroitDaveOptionsPlayer,True,2019-06-11 11:30:00,66.597,TNDM Cup Handle Formation Not a pretty one but its there and that wedge has reached its inflection point so I think the MMs brought down the stock after the conference because some of the big boys wanted in bury not at its current price so they brought it down Calls out paces Puts its ready for lift off There was a double top at 7356 back in late March so that is the resistance point we need to break but once it does clear sailing until earnings Theres an outside chance TNDM becomes profitable but there were forecasting by Q4 I am very curious on how their international sales are going if they beat raise guidance its goes to 100 by January
AllPaoTeam,True,2019-06-11 11:10:00,67.529,TNDM Love the morning dips
alekach,True,2019-06-11 10:58:00,66.75,TNDM the reason for the drop is simply the quantity of news that came out of the conference and the sea of speculation as to what it all means Speculation that was reflected all over this board yesterday I am long here and looking for any opportunity to add
Mixedbag,,2019-06-11 10:47:00,66.585,TNDM Sorry Guys This is only down because I bought it yesterday and its probably never going back to 70 again
