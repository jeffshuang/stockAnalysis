mikhael37,,2019-06-11 09:54:00,96.132,AMZN A good way to play this is to use put or call credit spreads that are a safe distance away maybe 100 from current price every week you can easily net 4 5 profit doing this Might be a better strategy to use with less volatile stocks ETFs such as SPY or GLD Another good candidate is EA which is fairly stable and has a favorable set of strike intervals to minimize collateral
