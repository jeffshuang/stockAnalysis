tbonesteak33,,2019-06-11 11:15:00,1.245,CIDM this is what I get for being born on Friday the 13th
Striker77,,2019-06-11 11:04:00,1.34,CIDM Seems some things never change Gone for 6 months and back Seeing the company have no response for getting their asses kicked is what I remember best
LoyalShark,,2019-06-11 09:58:00,1.37,CIDM Check this out It only took 82918 shares approx 120000 being shorted over 6 days to drop the stock 30 or 23000000 in market value THAT IS 23 MILLION on 120000 worth of trades Crazy
tbonesteak33,,2019-06-11 09:37:00,1.423,CIDM adding more fidelity is setting a 3000 share limit per trade so have to run multiple executions but 140 and change is cheap
LoyalShark,,2019-06-11 09:31:00,1.43,CIDM Ear to the ground The pullback is just noise Everything on track with acquisition still hope to have it in the bag this month Going to take advantage of this opportunity
