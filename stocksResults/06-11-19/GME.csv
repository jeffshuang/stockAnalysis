Kerbouchard,,2019-06-11 14:38:00,5.715,GME The new Xbox console Scarlett was the biggest news to emerge from Microsofts E3 2019 press conference However despite revealing many of Scarletts specs the company did not confirm whether the device would include a physical disc driveFortunately Xbox boss Phil Spencer has since reassured fans that Scarlett will indeed include a disc drive He told GamesIndustrybiz that physical games are a part of the companys future and went on to say We know that people still have discs So even when we put out things like the Xbox One S AllDigital edition we are very clear with the name because I am not trying to confuse anybody that if you are somebody that has a library of discs or thats the way you want to acquire the content then you should buy the Xbox One S not the Xbox One S AllDigital which is why we put it in the name and yes I know it says SAD
