udupisek,,2019-06-11 12:06:00,0.5079,DRRX Good opportunity to buy at this level Buying more I see there are more buys accumulation than sell I dont know why the price is kept low May be absence of of PR and uncertainty with June 24 approaching DRRX will be switched to NASDAQ National market soon The 2H will be the biggest game changer hopefully Till then there will be volatility i guess It is a bad time to sell Market makers shorts naked shorting may be keeping the stock price low Very painful to see there is no major interest with the institutional investors
