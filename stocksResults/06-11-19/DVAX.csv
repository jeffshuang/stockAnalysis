PanicOTack,,2019-06-11 10:39:00,3.817,DVAX Stunning drop So Heplisav gets approved They start marketing SD101 is no worse than 12 months ago even more encouraging data actually and the stock is down 81 Makes sense All data points have existed for last 23 quarters including loan info Only major variable is Eddies firing And that instead should have lifted the stock Stock should pop on new CEO appointment But theyll have to throw millions at that candidate to get him to accept THIS post under these conditions
RodRosenstein,False,2019-06-11 10:34:00,3.789,DVAX and the nightmare continues

lak1965,,2019-06-11 10:12:00,3.78,DVAX Im holding until next financials or news which will come like a thief in the night and many will get caught with there shorts down LOL
bjjblue,,2019-06-11 10:10:00,3.76,DVAX Needs to name a competent CEO ASAP and he needs to outline a plan for company success This drop is way worse than even the most dire predictions from dumbsheet let that sink in So oversold right now

lak1965,,2019-06-11 10:08:00,3.772,DVAX Shorts cant make money if you dont sell them your shares Unless they go bankrupt which I doubt thats why I have a sell at 25 bucks to tie up my shares so they cant be used for shorting
InvesTech,True,2019-06-11 09:59:00,3.84,DVAX SD101 sale in the next 30 days it seems
Gainwealth,,2019-06-11 09:55:00,3.86,DVAX wondering why they dont just do 90 sell in one day instead of 5 drop each day
