Trade2Winner,,2019-06-11 09:42:00,18.24,AMRN Heres the bottom line on these stupid chronic bear themes 1 The mineral oil thing is bullshit Flat out If it did what Pyrrh is claiming it does you would not have seen the results you saw You would see a consistently deteriorating LDLC profile over the full trial period Thats not what you see You see a revert to the mean in the short term and a stable LDLC profile after that Period Its bullshit 2 AMRNs patent profile is strong If it wasnt TEVA would be selling it now Theyre the global giant and they agreed to leave AMRN alone until 2029 Period Thats the end of it Its 226 pages of FUD Conclusions assumed and fact patterns backfilled to fit them This could be done with almost any trial
atri1234,,2019-06-11 09:39:00,18.28,AMRN markets up big time and then there are s Amrn Let us see what she does today
Trade2Winner,,2019-06-11 09:38:00,18.245,AMRN JELIS no mineral oil used showed a 19 RRR with 18g EPAday REDUCEIT which showed a 25 RRR with 4g EPAday could be viewed as a confirmatory trial with p00000001 In fact the 25 RRR is actually an understatement of the true RRR of 4gday EPA therapy due to patient compliance issue especially in Eastern EuropeRussia To conclude the REDUCEIT trial result is iron clad 4gday EPA cuts CV death by 20 Your hypothesis 4gday mineral oil causing malabsorption of lipid medications hence producing additional 20 in CV death despite none of those available lipid medications have any proven CV death reduction benefits does not make theoretical and practical sense
