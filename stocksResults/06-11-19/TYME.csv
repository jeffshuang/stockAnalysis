Jbloom111,,2019-06-11 15:18:00,1.038,TYME Years ago I refurbished a 1967 Cobra with a small block engine I initially cleaned the fuel line and the engine would run then rapidly lose power I decided to change the fuel line and put a brand new one in the car That one small step turned my Cobra into a monster of a sports car with 425 horsepower in a 2300 pound car The TYME engine will get it right and soon it will be a classic
