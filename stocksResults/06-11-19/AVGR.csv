Casinobully,,2019-06-11 15:46:00,0.4852,APRN made a small play here its low enough to buy and forget it Gotta thank WKHS for the now just using some to make plays with PINS and APRN even tossed some at AVGR for fun seriously check WKHS as Im only here because of selling half my position there so I have some extra to spread around until WKHS dips under my average and I buy more there like hammer time in the 90s baby

moneytrader2017,,2019-06-11 10:15:00,0.4988,AVGR with the comments you people are making its obvious you know nothing about Naked Short Selling This stock is and has been Naked Shorted for the past several monthsSEC IS a POS for not following through on the complaints and proof that has been hand delivered to them The company can also restrict short selling with a few phone callsIf I didnt know better Id say the executives are shorting their own company
