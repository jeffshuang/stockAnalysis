Fixaleg,False,2019-06-11 12:45:00,39.9,GSK failed to move through the 50100dma areas and now has engulfing bearish daily chart as it pushes back below 200dma Watching for support around 383x area and then 37 if unable to hold
Fixaleg,False,2019-06-11 11:54:00,39.982,GSK looks like death cross coming as 50dma targeting that 200dma and price action has failed last 3 days to penetrate Gap fill down to 389x area at minimum and may find support around that area on the 20dma Watching for double tap on the 383x to go long
