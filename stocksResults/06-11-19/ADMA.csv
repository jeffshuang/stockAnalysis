Ronaldo86,True,2019-06-11 14:02:00,3.624,ADMA After speaking directly with IR it appears that the Biotest fiasco was not necessarily a surprise No bad blood per se and we have likely encountered a phase of the most brazen shorting yet as the 90 day overhang creates a scenario for shorts to exploit Will be very interesting to see the short interest report in next update Theyre going full retard on lock up SP will bounce as this activity is not sustainable

StnMtn,,2019-06-11 12:47:00,3.516,ADMA Lol This is about the share price I calculated when they announced PO of about 20 shares when SP about 44 8x44352 However back then it only dropped to to 39 and CEO bought shares at 4 When it refused to drop below 365 the past week when I had set buy limit at 365 this morning when someone did the headfake buy for 4 shares for 469 AND I read a ivestment bank like Raymond James was selling at 375 I figured 375 was a safe bet and reset buy limits to 375 Guess I was off by about 6 Hope to see recovery over the next week
