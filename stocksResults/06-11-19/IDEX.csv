Luckylala,,2019-06-11 14:49:00,1.82,IDEX Yup knew it another pump so that Bruno and his China friends can sell off shares Someone is getting rich off these pumps and it aint you because they have tricked you into going LONG
Gimmepaw,,2019-06-11 14:08:00,1.83,IDEX PGDA is right we ARE consolidating after a big move If that post truly seems threatening to you maybe the internet isnt your thing Do a little self assessment on why you can have normal conversations
WOWidex,True,2019-06-11 13:59:00,1.817,IDEX As I understand correctly to the moon is possible in 2024 and a ticket to ISS station cost 58 million dollar if you want to join as a tourist So its funny but Idex to the moon will be much cheaper and faster I think

broche003,True,2019-06-11 13:29:00,1.82,IDEX to the moon is a fascinating phrase if you think about it What is your definition of to the moon I bet mine is different than yours And yours is different than most others To the moon might mean to 5 for some and 20 for others Maybe even 100 for some It simply depends on where you bought in at and what your goals are I really like this stock and do believe its going to my moonits just going to be a long journey For me this wont make me rich in a week month or year It will be at least a few years but the long hold will be worth it in my opinion Stay patient A few years from now will be here before you know it
