WhackaMole,True,2019-06-11 11:33:00,20.39,AXDX I suspect shorts keep banging away and if we dip much lower Jack will step in and buy so insider buying gets bigger short interest gets bigger and the Float shrinks What is wrong with this picture At some point the float shrinks to zero Jack and Oracle have enough money to buy the remaining float So at the boundary condition Insiders will own all the shares and SHORTS have nowhere to go borrow stock I have been told by people that know Jack Schuler well that he an extremely shrewd and active trader Of course he did this at Ventana Redux So the technical aspects of the trade coupled with Regulatory Approvals on new products and successful commercialization will all point to a disastrous ending for Shorts aka Volkswagen Porsche billionaire SHORT LOST ALL his money gawkercom5124449ruineda
WhackaMole,True,2019-06-11 11:11:00,20.515,AXDX Short interest coming out after the close today for the end of May Will be interesting to see if Shorts stayed at it Hope it increased
