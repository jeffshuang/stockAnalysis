Sykes,,2019-06-10 10:09:00,78.692,ICPT it seems like this wont have a gradual move up Most likely a slingshot move and when it happens u r either in or out to reap the benefit Used to be a great trading stock n its not anymore NDA filing within the next 4months Give yourself a yr for the big move Dont buy if u dont believe in approval But shorting at this level is not going to give a big gain because current share price is almost at the bottom n wise theres not much room to drop but if they get approval then theres a lot to loose Im betting on the long side for a 500 move up Lets see where she land in the next few months I believe theres liver conferences in November and icpt would have heard back from FDA regarding their NDA filings So this will be in for some fun time towards the fall
