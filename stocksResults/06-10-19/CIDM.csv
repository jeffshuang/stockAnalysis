LoyalShark,,2019-06-10 15:15:00,1.36,CIDM Added the Regression to the Mean line Volume is still lite RSI of 17 Way over done Thursday fear Friday panicMonday melt down and Tuesday cool heads prevail sign on on the wall of my office for past 30 years BTFD
LoyalShark,,2019-06-10 14:52:00,1.36,CIDM When CIDM was trading at 150 last falland no one had ever heard of Future Today Zachs analyst Lisa Thompson placed a 450 price target on CIDM saying the OTT division alone was worth more than what the entire company was trading for
LoyalShark,,2019-06-10 14:48:00,1.389,CIDM So when CIDM was trading at 85cts and Future Today was not even in the cards Dawson initiated coverage with a 267 price target

LoyalShark,,2019-06-10 13:36:00,1.37,CIDM 22700000 market value lost since June 4 on a WHOPPING 300915 shares SO approx 514000 worth of trades some of those are actually buys take 227 MILLION worth of market value away from Cinedigm shareholders That is less than 1 of the stock trading and causing this mess A little over done Id say

CNels67,,2019-06-10 12:58:00,1.4,CIDM I bought on the dip IMO theyll get on track and are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities
tbonesteak33,,2019-06-10 10:23:00,1.386,CIDM I guess the market wanted to hear the future today deal closed in the presentation but didnt get it
LoyalShark,,2019-06-10 09:58:00,1.45,CIDM Should have real strong support here at 145 nothing like opening the door to fear not having the Future Today deal done while not even having your earnings out from Jan Mar Q just amazing the ignorance in reporting earnings that late we go through this every year Like to see a solid V occur here with 145 being the test of support and then working to get back over 179 for the next run higher
LoyalShark,,2019-06-10 09:45:00,1.45,CIDM Cant blame the market for ripping the head off Cinedigm CIDM is on the verge of some great things but when you allow fear to set in like Cinedigm has done you deserve to get slaughtered The market supported the stock for 4 fricken months at break out levels unbelievable
