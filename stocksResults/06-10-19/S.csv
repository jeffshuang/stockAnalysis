TheMonk,True,2019-06-10 13:00:00,7.15,S Question is what will TMUS rise to on approval of merger That I am guessing is what everyone is wondering Best plan may be to keep the TMUS shares as if they win the 5G business it could skyrocket That is where the true value may be in S Just my opinion so always do your own DD This is more long range and not for day traders which many are here
TheMonk,True,2019-06-10 12:23:00,7.175,S we are dependent on TMUS price stock of course I am long S but we need TMUS to also rally on the news of approval when it comes It is for sure a balancing act at this level
