Equitymasters,,2019-06-10 12:21:00,162.8,FDX I am commenting about the company not the stock I live in New York City I ordered online a coffee table from a company located in California The shipment made it across the country to New Jersey just across the river On the day of the delivery they decided to return the shipment back to the sender with the justification that the package is too heavy to be delivered It made it it through 95 of the distance then they decided it was too heavy If they had called I would have gone and pick it up myself Now I have to wait another two weeks for the shipment I have heard too many people complaining how Fedex handles the packages But my case was not just unheard of but also silly If they dont change business models they might in trouble for being unreliable
