coolcoal,,2019-06-10 14:50:00,3.105,CPG should be a big draw in inventories this week me thinks What goes import one week goes export next week coupled with increased usage Well see but Im back to owning cpg now
staffpro1,,2019-06-10 11:31:00,3.122,CPG if this cant rally with market at all time highs imagine what it will do when the sp500 takes another dip I used to think underlying value of a companies assets could prevent a stock from going down further after dropping 94 but thats not true I guess those 1 calls this call are a possibility same with BTE same with MEGCA theres no retail left buying oil they are all in marijuana or tech when market goes down that money exits it doesnt ever go into oil or resources these industries need massive consolidation in order to regain some relevance otherwise all these names are eventual 0s
