Stone52,,2019-06-10 15:09:00,14.19,EOLS questions from EU Commission 1 why are you selling a stolen toxin 2 why did Alpheon screw all the shareholders by announcing a secondary on launch day 3 why did you take out a 95 100m loan when you could have sold shares 12 points higher 4 why are you per the conference call burning 500k per year just for each employee
JEFFBOND,True,2019-06-10 14:54:00,14.18,BYND If only the real SHORT SQUEEZE would begin in the more deserving EOLS and NIO its all about timing and the time will come soon

Sectorseer,True,2019-06-10 12:18:00,14.41,EOLS The SA article says EU approval may be extended 90 days but its wrong The update said it could possibly extend beyond the original 90 day time period It said nothing about being extended an additional 90 days so fucking pissed at SA for dumb ass writers SA Quote Evolus EOLS 14 reports that the expected approval of Nuceiva prabotulinumtoxinAxvfsbranded as Jeuveau in the US by the European Commission may be delayed 90 days to allow it to review supplementary information that it requested from the European Medicines Agency and its advisory group CHMP SEC Exact Quote from FORM 8K The request for supplemental information may result in the EC extending its final decision on approval beyond the 90 days previously stated by the Company Fucking SA Retards Print a fucking retraction now dumb asses
JDSecurities,,2019-06-10 12:08:00,14.517,EOLS adding another 14th to my position Almost have my full position Will save some powder in case it drops to 13s again

tpayne1130,,2019-06-10 11:20:00,14.42,EOLS I hope when we win suit we can be awarded a couple billion for damages
crackpot,,2019-06-10 11:17:00,14.33,EOLS Why are AGNDaewoong asking for delay in ITC trial Because need more time to develop a case lies Medy ready to go and wants to accelerate timeline
Desflurane,,2019-06-10 11:13:00,14.555,EOLS Cat is still alive Bounce Fun
JackKo,True,2019-06-10 10:59:00,14.565,EOLS it needs this 0 movement for couple of weeks to consolidate Stop the volatility then go slowly up to 25 into the earnings
CheeseCityBeerMan,True,2019-06-10 10:56:00,14.412,EOLS looking like delay was already priced in from Friday Says timeline MAY be affected If they can provide all supplemental info quickly I doubt it extends past the initial 90 days
sktrader1,,2019-06-10 10:53:00,14.303,EOLS a drop was expected all Though I believe the delay to be inconsequential and will be resolved quickly there ppl who were getting in for that event Plus lets face it havent caught a lot of breaks here lately That being said it wasnt rejected They didnt go back to Evolus for more information which wouldve implied far worse The ST volatility and lack of events going our way is certainly frustrating However from a future valuation standpoint nothing has changed Just bigger pop when approval comes as will come at a more unexpected date
Desflurane,,2019-06-10 10:45:00,14.137,EOLS I think this dead cat stopped bouncing
Tradeberny,True,2019-06-10 10:42:00,14.145,EOLS Now we know why the sudden drop Friday It seems the few and the privileged always get the inside info before the crowd One positive is that the possibility of a delay in EU is already priced in the stock as US launch ramps up quickly and ahead of expectations Downside very limited as confirmed sales start pushing the stock price higher in the next few weeks
OptimalGeek,False,2019-06-10 10:40:00,14.149,EOLS if it doesnt hold 1408 you will end up seeing 13 again
