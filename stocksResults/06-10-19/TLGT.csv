robert1599,True,2019-06-10 15:48:00,0.5601,TLGT Well they are pushing it down hard with low volume I am wondering if they found a lead plaintiff in the class action lawsuit The deadline is the 14th this week
MooseShartley,,2019-06-10 15:48:00,0.5601,TLGT This thing is 85 owned by institutionsI cant believe they arent clamoring for some kind of impactful moves from management
MooseShartley,,2019-06-10 14:59:00,0.5701,TLGT Im desperately waiting for that first injectable approval announcementThat will be the first step towards turning this around
plum,,2019-06-10 14:56:00,0.5701,TLGT If you go to their website there are a lot of job postings

MooseShartley,,2019-06-10 14:41:00,0.5718,TLGT Weve had some success emailing the companys officers in the past I wonder if anyone has tried to contact them today to get an actual comment on last weeks PR
MooseShartley,,2019-06-10 14:39:00,0.5718,TLGT Interesting thing about their press release on Friday is that the letter from the SEC was dated June 5th which means they sat on it for two days and didnt release the info until After Hours on June 7th
MooseShartley,,2019-06-10 13:40:00,0.5822,TLGT Ive been trying to get mreyes6442 to clarify his repeated comments about management loaning out 500k shares of the stock to be shorted Does anyone understand WTF he is talking about or is it just complete unadulterated bashing
UDel30,,2019-06-10 13:11:00,0.582,TLGT any positive news volume and this goes back up been too quiet for too long
jerzypawlik,True,2019-06-10 13:11:00,0.582,TLGT the share price means nothing here Facilities State of Arts is worth more thanMthan MC of this Company never mind the product and new FDA approvals coming 100k traded dont mean nothing
Genesis99,,2019-06-10 13:06:00,0.59,TLGT this very sad nothing from management they all need to be fired
jmckenna,,2019-06-10 12:30:00,0.6009,TLGT I know this is all a bit depressing but again this is all on very little volume literally a 100k200kday so it is completely meaningless This stock is being driven by people who own a few thousand shares When you see days with over 1m of shares traded that will be more indicative of where the stock is headed until then just ignore the noise
Kevin_Wolcott,,2019-06-10 11:23:00,0.6168,TLGT If they cant turn things around by the end if Q1 2020 they are in big troubleReported 6M cash and 150M debt end of March Loan after loan
