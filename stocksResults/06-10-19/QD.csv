pvalenti,,2019-06-10 14:34:00,7.315,QD nice move today but weekly chart still has a bullish posture needs some news and volume to kick start it some more
jdollartsun,,2019-06-10 12:45:00,7.324,QD On the weekly chart we are looking for a weekly close above 778 resistance from 3 weeks ago Also major resistance of 850 from 6 weeks ago Only thing that will keep this from ripping is high floating shares of about 180mil
metrostock,True,2019-06-10 12:41:00,7.33,QD could the Mexican tarrif issue be a precusor to resolution to China tarris
jdollartsun,,2019-06-10 12:29:00,7.32,QD Well from the looks of the daily chart seems this will break above resistance in next couple of days or make one more quick trip down to 7690ish and then make a big move up end of week perhaps Nice bull move today but not breakout volume yet
