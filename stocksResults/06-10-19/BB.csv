Tam8261,,2019-06-10 09:38:00,8.005,BB Trying this again Forgive the redundancy if my earlier post shows up on the feed CRM buying DATA for 15b Unreal Why cant Chen sell BBIts abundantly clear no matter what he does the share price is not going to move beyond its current range I dont get itI am really tempted to fly up for the shareholders meeting and raise hell Peak market and the share price languishesThese mega SW deals by other companies erode my confidence in Chen Id like to ask him directly what the end game is here
