notSouki,True,2019-06-10 10:58:00,0.3833,PLM A lot of fear here The fundamentals havent changed Solid entry point for new investors imo
KeepWaiting,False,2019-06-10 10:30:00,0.3851,PLM Sad I mean that They literally bent over the investors that kept them afloat long enough to get to this point in the first place Itd be incredible if it wasnt the game plan of basically every junior mining permit process out there Learn and play it different next time This is how it goes
markwyatt,,2019-06-10 10:17:00,0.382,PLM What is the case against buying it now below offering then selling the rights which hopefully will increase in price
WVUTrip,,2019-06-10 10:00:00,0.3794,PLM Lol Glencore at it again Keep this thing below offering price until offering expires so no one exercises their rights
mwaszczak,,2019-06-10 09:59:00,0.37,PLM below offering price on purpose so no one will do the offering Lol
