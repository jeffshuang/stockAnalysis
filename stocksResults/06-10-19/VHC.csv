WannaMillion,,2019-06-10 12:32:00,6.23,VHC The CAFC is Rule 36ing appeals heard at the same time as ours What is the delay with ours Are they writing something to slam Apple further or waiting for Apple to fold It is anyones guess but will the government trust Apple with Gabriel technology for government use I am on the fence

IPcurious,,2019-06-10 12:22:00,6.249,VHC Just to be clear and please go back and look at my all my old posts I firmly believe that VHC should prevail over Apple for justice to be done However I would never hold this stock long term Furthermore as I explained the courts are stacked against the little guy in favor of the big behemoth companies Apple Google etc which is why I think the CAFC is going to pull something out of their arse to find a way to screw VHC Just like they did to Vringo several years ago after Vringo now XSPA secured a billion dollar judgment against Google CAFC destroyed XSPA the market cap is less than 110th what it was during the Google trial All VHC has for them is to pray the CAFC enforces the trial courts judgment VHC has nothing else going for them if for some reason CAFC rules in favor of Apple this stock will crumble to 2 and maybe even 1 People should be aware and informed and not invest with emotion
IPcurious,,2019-06-10 12:15:00,6.263,VHC Even blind squirrels find nuts sometimes Or better yet a broken clock is right twice a day Its very difficult to produce no revenue for almost 10 years Yet KL does it with ease Every announcement of some sham agreement or distribution of the Gabriel Suite has bore no fruit Empty promises and empty agreements but one thing KL does not forget about is to pay him and his wife handsomely probably other family members as well Travel in style on a private jet all on YOUR dime The CEOs of MedMen a cannabis stock cut their pay from 15MM to 50k as the stock has been taking a beating Thats what a CEO does to show he wants to protect hard earned investor capital KL could care less about you as long as he keeps collecting his salary and stock options all he has to do is make up some sham agreement every year or two and bring on new noob longs to hold the bag Congratulations to all the shareholders for funding KLs family lifestyle Kudos to you

BritishSon,True,2019-06-10 10:41:00,6.25,VHC is close very close to its mandate at the cafc Any day now With this mandate obtained by fighting and winning against one of the biggest legal powerhouses in the world licensing or buyout will happen 8 million shorted shares will be made to pay the price in the market for the folly they employed for so long now The time is near
WitchKingOfAngmar,True,2019-06-10 10:18:00,6.23,VHC What a bunch of crap KL has busted his butt And if you think its only cares about him you are an idiot Yea hes used a jet for business purposes Get over it Hes taken on aapl and won Not his fault the courts have been stacked against him Hes taken personal attacks from them that would cripple a lot of you Were close Just see what happens when the CAFC rules Make these no licence trolls look like the fools they are

Traderpro45,,2019-06-10 09:55:00,6.18,VHC opmoney gets on my nerves too however what hes saying about all the failed licensing agreement is fact KL just strings everyone along so they can keep paying his salary and his wifes salary Dont listen to tafa unless you want to lose all your money KL only cares about himself and this new agreement wont create any revenue for V either
