CriticalCapital,,2019-06-10 14:37:00,1.46,EYPT a close at 142 would set up for an interesting day tomorrow
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 13:53:00,1.465,EYPT short interest going up 090 inbound Very likely Break 145 again and we settle down to 105
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 13:38:00,1.485,EYPT gimme 090 and I will load the boat Too risky stock Ocul looks better positioned for success

Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 12:00:00,1.456,EYPT she even went to investors conference with no new info Everything was already there So why did they even wasted money to sign up for conference and paying for extra lavish trip for her and her minions And all this while she is not even making any money for company Wow What a Royal mess Wait till 072 Not far Any moment Just hang in there folks
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 11:58:00,1.455,EYPT yeah she needs to go This is beyond explanation
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 11:55:00,1.455,EYPT to me it looks like slow and steady dump I think they want to bring her to 092 then unload last lot to drop it hard to 050 and then settle around 075 Thats more logical explanation of current movement than three point imaginary extrapolation
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 11:52:00,1.44,EYPT volume up and stock down To me thats unloading process Stay away Until insiders get their spine back and buy the stock at this price Put your money where your mouth is Nancy Bulls on this boards are associated with company in some capacity so they have clear motive to influence

Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-10 10:36:00,1.44,EYPT just imagine other company in this position If CEO brought stock down from 377 to 140 not only board would have fired CEO but they would have them payback lost market cap But not with Nancy Coz she has enough suckers around her to eat whatever crap she would feed Btw chrissy is missing Where is she What happened to 10 share theory
