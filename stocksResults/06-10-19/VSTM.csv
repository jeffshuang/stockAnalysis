siteobserver,True,2019-06-10 14:36:00,1.235,VSTM Actually the plan is kind of simple accumulate around 120 and hold until double digit scrips become the norm which then compound as refills are booked then keep holding as revenue growth kicks us up a notch in 2H

siteobserver,,2019-06-10 12:43:00,1.28,VSTM We should expect starting off the last month of Q2 with double digit scrips and if every week in June is double digits that will offer some modest evidence that scrip levels are stabilizing and refills are accumulating This is setting up a strong second half

keremoner,,2019-06-10 10:08:00,1.292,BIOC I am being realistic here Two friends who work in the biotech field Amgen and a Japanese firm both are unimpressed with their product They think the hope lies in being bought out as there have been some talk about may be a long shot Unfortunately I am long 2500 shares at 170 so I will be holding until hell breaks loose I guess This VSTM and TTOO are three stocks I wish I never heard of My other losers like CPRX and NBRV are at least trying to overcome temporary difficulties They have the pipeline and approvals to assure bright future for them
