bluemooncapital,True,2019-06-10 14:43:00,2.69,SLNO maybe Baker Bros finally decided to buy in after todays meeting If we get a Baker Bros filing so will go through the roof 10 easy
SpanishRetailer,,2019-06-10 14:18:00,2.67,SLNO for those with spare money check out HJLI this week risky short term but worth the risk to buy around 120135 and hold long term they might do an offering around 175 I think it has the potential for double digits in 1824 months maybe sooner Id also like to buy some SRNE MEDIF and XLRN but I dont have liquidity right now
SpanishRetailer,,2019-06-10 14:11:00,2.67,SLNO I guess someone left todays meeting happy and decided to buy more shares hahaha we usually have so little volume and a low float that literally any small spike in volume means a 45 move in price Kinda scary hopefully for good the way this could move with massive volume on major news definitely the kind of stock that could go 200300 up any given day then lose 70 the next day or just have a crazy 300 spread
bluemooncapital,True,2019-06-10 13:58:00,2.69,SLNO next leg on its way wont stop till it hits 500 news imminent
MaRkShOrT,,2019-06-10 13:30:00,2.57,SLNO seeing some bids lining up
Suu13,True,2019-06-10 11:36:00,2.565,SLNO OVAS worth 13 per share we about to get there DCCR in PWS has shown good results in the past our trial is about significant changes in that rare disease and DSMB recommended continuation less than 3 months ago
bluemooncapital,True,2019-06-10 11:23:00,2.58,SLNO primary trial completion June 2019 and guess what month we are in When we get full enrollment news this will start one massive run up into data and possible send us well into double digits before p3 readout There will be a first jump with a 30 pullback landing us somewhere over 500 and then a steady jagged run up into the end of year With good results 30 to 50 pps Enjoy and dont get off 2 early
bluemooncapital,True,2019-06-10 10:59:00,2.549,SLNO 500 short term pt here Looking for reversal on the cup and handle Next leg up beginning
bluemooncapital,True,2019-06-10 10:37:00,2.531,SLNO nice cup and handle formation from a technical perspective
