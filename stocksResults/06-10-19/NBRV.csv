sonajoseph,True,2019-06-10 12:58:00,1.915,NBRV Reached the my support line between 170 to 190 Strong buy Less down side risk now
Jsnielsen,True,2019-06-10 12:16:00,1.929,NBRV just remember this boys and girlsOn April 30 2019 we received a Complete Response Letter CRL from the FDA for the NDA The CRL requests that Nabriva address issues related to facility inspections and manufacturing deficiencies at one of Nabrivas contract manufacturers prior to the FDA approving the NDA Nabriva plans to request a Type A meeting to discuss the FDAs findings The FDA did not request any new clinical data and did not raise any concerns with regard to the safety of CONTEPOThe FDA has granted CONTEPO QIDP and Fast TrackThere was an issues with the manufacture not the drug just hold who cares if approval comes in August or September if the average price target for the share is 7

HeyU2001,,2019-06-10 11:53:00,1.898,NBRV Sorry forgot the link to the Institutional Holding nasdaqcomsymbolnbrvinst Short interest has crept up as well driving this stock lower so someone can accumulate it at a lower price nasdaqcomsymbolnbrvshor I like the short interest increasing and the Tutes selling Means when shorts cover and Tutes want in along with retail we will get some good buying

HeyU2001,,2019-06-10 11:24:00,1.864,NBRV Did everyone see a couple weeks ago the end of 1st quarter 13F filings showed Institutional Holding down significantly Keep in mind this is reported quarterly and they dont have to release data until 45 days after the close of the quarter so the data is extremely laggingTute Holding went from 52 to 40 and a lot of big names are missing The MC of this company keeps many out of the stock but at some point Tutes will come back into this stock and you want to make sure you are locked and loaded From here lower or higher is anyones guess today

keremoner,,2019-06-10 10:08:00,1.824,BIOC I am being realistic here Two friends who work in the biotech field Amgen and a Japanese firm both are unimpressed with their product They think the hope lies in being bought out as there have been some talk about may be a long shot Unfortunately I am long 2500 shares at 170 so I will be holding until hell breaks loose I guess This VSTM and TTOO are three stocks I wish I never heard of My other losers like CPRX and NBRV are at least trying to overcome temporary difficulties They have the pipeline and approvals to assure bright future for them
