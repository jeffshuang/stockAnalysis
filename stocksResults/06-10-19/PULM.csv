PULM,,2019-06-10 15:56:00,0.975,PULM almost certain this flushes to 092 and 50 certain it flushes to 082 to TEST those two lows that were set thing that isnt so certain is if the test attracts real buyers and recovers from those tests to prove itself that is the REAL quetsion in my mind hmmmmm well have to wait to see

prabhj,,2019-06-10 15:45:00,0.975,PULM is it at 200 100 22 wait a min 500 sorry its at 98 Only difference is decimal point Have you noticed today dear friend owinski did not post his routine patiently bullish post I think he left from this short heaven May be he has realised that its going for another reverse split now and going short now I told many here that only way to people are making money is short No bag holder can say that I am in green The day you buy next moment it takes you into red zone 36 months of bleeding for longs and 36 glorious months of shorts

PULM,,2019-06-10 11:35:00,0.9868,PULM CFMS CRMD CVRS are three examples of charts that went from PULM type multiyear DOWN trends to UP trends on the weekly chart PULM not showing the same characteristics that those showedare showing as they march slowly higher close and HOLD above 120 is the minimum price needed for the start of any movejust my opinion

rezin8,,2019-06-10 10:32:00,0.9798,PULM dont wanna be the bringer of bad news but until we see a royal flush this will probably keep doing the same Looking for a high volume sell off and a rebound candle with a long tail None of this is very exciting for sure
