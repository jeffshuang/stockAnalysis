Ryael,True,2019-06-10 15:27:00,0.7309,LTBR Lets hope that when the contract goes through we can get a similar treatment to Beyond Meat The big question with valuation is how excited people get seeing the numbersThe big thing to watch for will be PriceSales ratio or how many multipliers the market cap is above annual revenue What we need to hope for is an announcement of multiple reactors at a site andor a decently long contract Valuation could get seriously insane Im planning for 5share and hoping for moreIF YOURE PLANNING ON SELLING HAVE A PLAN News and action could take a while to disseminate 3 days 1 month 3 months Tough to say Ill be watching the Ichimoku Cloud for a decent exit location Plan is to sell 50 of position for profit and hold the other 50 for a decade If news really picks up on the story and it makes a big splash this thing really could rip We are talking over a billion dollar market cap but I dont think itll be permanent yet Could also hit 5 and fizzleShow More
BusinessClass,,2019-06-10 14:50:00,0.7413,LTBR I believe the JV has value but not Tremendous Value I say this because the price fell to all time lows with the JV in place It positions LTBR to make money but for many justified reasons everyone is skeptical anything thats happened thus far will ever produce money So one could argue everything this company has ever done has been fluff The JV and the GAIN voucher come close to pulling us out of that but not quite If they get a utility contract with attached it will be the first Tremendous thing this company has ever done I think we all realize with the history of LTBR and Seth at the helm those are long odds but I guess not impossible and thats what keeps us foolishly in for the win
