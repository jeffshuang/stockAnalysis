james42349,,2019-06-10 15:14:00,6.275,AUPH Vote Green Mgmt compensation has been going through the roof ripping off share holders Aurinia has misleadingly stated that ILJIN is nominating three directors which when taken with ILJINs existing representative Dr Hyuek Joon Lee will give ILJIN control of the board Aurinia conveniently neglects to acknowledge that ILJIN has expressly recommended that shareholders WITHHOLD their votes for Dr Lee and that one of our three nominees is intended as a replacement As such ILJIN does not want to nor can it with a three 3 director minority slate take control Rather ILJIN wants to give all shareholders more control ILJINs nominees have no prior relationships with each other of any nature and have been selected because they have the requisite expertise and can be expected to act independently of each other and of ILJIN
