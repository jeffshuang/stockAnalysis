KentuckyfriedRabbit,,2019-06-10 14:45:00,4.7,HYRE Any idea when management will announce completed trialspartnership with OEM I assume they will make big announcement before they ask for shareholders supportvote later this month Otherwise I am voting against management and will seek to shake things up yup I know they have insane growth but I expect 1012 before years end and I want to see more than 78 before June 25
