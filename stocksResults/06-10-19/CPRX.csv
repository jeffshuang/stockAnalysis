Stockswiz,True,2019-06-10 15:52:00,3.298,CPRX this baby will be back to where it belongs in 5 or 6 s soon
arang,,2019-06-10 15:42:00,3.265,CPRX Seriously how this stock can keep go down like this with good outlook Such a shit stock but cant sell now
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-10 15:38:00,3.265,CPRX MMs just pushing it up and down looking for volume These moves are insignificant in the grand scheme of things
keremoner,,2019-06-10 15:33:00,3.278,CPRX well the only reason i am sticking around is we saw what happened in April This baby can double in a matter of a couple of weeks All we need is something from either Catalyst mgmt or Jacobus pricingintentions to market Ruzurgi
momos,,2019-06-10 15:08:00,3.295,CPRX drip drip drip drip i feel like this will be the status quo until CPRX says something meaningful or jacobus does Id rather be on offense than defense
BigJuicy,True,2019-06-10 14:44:00,3.29,CPRX anyone on this board should do themselves a favor and block seemslogical I did this a few months back and it has been smooth sailing
seemslogical,,2019-06-10 14:36:00,3.287,CPRX Let me see if I get this right I can get a Viking walk in custom made refrigerator and a Range Rover with a glove compartment that cools along with huge house in a nice neighborhood if my compassionate use application gets rejected Look forward to Ruzurgi price point
LongFTW,True,2019-06-10 13:56:00,3.32,CPRX which one would you pick when you have to take this 34 times a day The refrigeration need one or the one that doesnt Pretty simple when they both be similar in cost to the individual
LongFTW,True,2019-06-10 13:54:00,3.322,CPRX Firdapse is approved to treat LEMS in adults and Ruzurgi is approved to treat LEMS in pediatric patients Firdapse contains amifampridine as the phosphate salt which is more stable than the base drug contained in Ruzurgi and therefore does not require refrigeration drugscommedicalanswersd
Time_Traveller,True,2019-06-10 13:44:00,3.345,CPRX Buying more to average down I love it
arang,,2019-06-10 12:35:00,3.348,CPRX This stock really loves to stay around this range
seemslogical,,2019-06-10 11:41:00,3.375,CPRX so easy to shake the tree here good luck to you guys will come back in the next phase of this company failure
dizzledip,True,2019-06-10 11:38:00,3.385,CPRX just hold on were going home
seemslogical,,2019-06-10 11:19:00,3.415,CPRX they spent little compared to other real biotechs that actually have a lab with scientists and doctors that actually develop a drug and go through the painful years of putting to market with hundreds of tested patents and many more phases and safety studies This company did squat and tried to ride the coat tails of BioMarins product and initially got the easy cheap pass to market That will is being criticized and now they are slowly and subtly being made an example of soon to be worth nothing and management in legal disarray
seemslogical,,2019-06-10 11:04:00,3.415,CPRX The reason the FDA approved another company to create distribute and sell the same exact drug is because you have a CEO that took the bait from of licensing this drug from BioMarin in an attempt to repackage it and sell it at am absurd price of 375000 per year which recent breakthru cancer drugs like KeyTruda dont even get So you have a CEO that pays himself a very handsome salary with issuing an enormous amount of shares that you all buy and what does he do with that bloated stupid salary and self issuance of bonus shares Buys more freaking shares and makes all you think there is inside buying on the open market by management Now you will notice he has clammed up and doesnt do this crp anymore because the FDA although they do not control price and business ethics they certainly can bring in a competitor with a subtle twist of purpose that doesnt tread in exclusivity rights and approve them to sell this insanely easy drug to develop for sale cheaper
seemslogical,,2019-06-10 10:32:00,3.393,CPRX not under one dollar yet Am surprised Also surprised the CEO isnt in prison yet
keremoner,,2019-06-10 10:08:00,3.417,BIOC I am being realistic here Two friends who work in the biotech field Amgen and a Japanese firm both are unimpressed with their product They think the hope lies in being bought out as there have been some talk about may be a long shot Unfortunately I am long 2500 shares at 170 so I will be holding until hell breaks loose I guess This VSTM and TTOO are three stocks I wish I never heard of My other losers like CPRX and NBRV are at least trying to overcome temporary difficulties They have the pipeline and approvals to assure bright future for them
SESTEN,,2019-06-10 09:57:00,3.43,CPRX considering selling out Hard to have this much patience
YoungChap,,2019-06-10 09:52:00,3.432,CPRX so basically we just need to wait until Q2 earnings
arang,,2019-06-10 09:45:00,3.465,CPRX GG volume
