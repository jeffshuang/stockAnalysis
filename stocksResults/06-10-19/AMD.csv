R_Type,,2019-06-10 11:48:00,34.071,My take if you give a shitIf AMD is going up because they are taking or going to take market share from INTC and since INTC has a significant share of the market and INTC is currently earning 468 per share annually it would follow in a perfect world then if AMD was to take 100 of Intels market share and AMD could charge Intel prices for thier products the best AMD could hope to do is 448 per share annually And if they were making 448 annually you could then expect it to be trading at no more 4648 per share Given that the world is not perfect that AMD is unlikely to take even 50 of Intels market share and given that AMD is probably going to have lower margins lower prices and given that AMD is only hoping to make 75 cents per share by 2020 is there really any upside left here Dont get me wrong I realize a short squeeze could send this flying but longterm it will find a rational price Im thinking there is not much upside left here
