Simpletrade,,2019-06-10 11:09:00,2.67,ONCS Likely will be bought by MRK for cheap price If they get AA before the BO then were talking about real profit Now I think its likely before so 5 to 10 I think If after AA we could fetch 20 to 50 Management screwed up big time
erice579,True,2019-06-10 10:37:00,2.68,ONCS early stage this was toxic for investors unfortunate Lets hope now that they have near completion phase 2 TAVO and begun new delivery systems they may seek new licensing deals and or accelerate to market by EOY 2019 In any case company is way undervalued based on current pipeline low os mc float and recent insidertute buying

Wazup,,2019-06-10 09:33:00,2.715,ONCS Just my opinion but they need to start revenues before any change in control Once they start revenues the stock will rally With a visible revenue stream they will get fair value for a buyout
