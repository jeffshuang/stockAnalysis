Extension_1605,True,2019-06-10 10:32:00,5.73,LCI I dont want to get too much into the fundamental weeds on Stocktwits but saving 33 million a year in your operations when working on a 40 gross margin is like NOT having to sell 82500000 to get the revenue to cover those expenses Just doing that will cover 41 of the loss of JSP Add in the margin from lets say 825 Million in new product sales and that covers 82 of the loss We are pretty much at that point now I will admit that I get lost as to when all of the new revenue kicks in and what it counts but I think 75MM to 83MM is reasonable to assume by the end of this year Will the market be convinced that that is a workable turnaround Who knows
