MSBio,,2019-06-10 11:47:00,3.805,ADMA Is it a reasonable expectation that the management will work out some kind of deals for some investors to get their hands on the biotest remaining shares instead of hurting the company further If I were the management I will do it

R8Plus,True,2019-06-10 11:27:00,3.77,ADMA heres my analysis of future sales aka lateral thinking Maybe they realized oh shit bivigam could be made at other plants or expand current plant By doing that theres nothing secretive about bivigam However you get alltime wt fractioners at home wt just asceniv Doing that Lowers Bivigam margin but will make a lot more on revenue end making up for the lower margins Plus its gives asceniv ability to make money wo worrying bout running fractioners Yeah if they cant make the bivigams marginThey can make it its just theyre going to have want to keep ultra specialized IVIG asceniv in house maintaining the secret Why not take the mass produced ones to a third party In that case margins fall to 2530 for bivigam but u make up for it by increasing volume of productionSay u can make 75100M at home on margins of 6070outsourcing it gotta make lots more like 250400M for margins of 30 is outstandingShow More
