tharpoon,False,2019-05-20 15:45:00,3.815,CPRX Historically stocks have generally fallen during days leading up to holidays because traders offload their holdings in order to avoid the risk of significant news appearing while the markets are closed Stocks also tend to rally the week after a long holiday weekend Check historic charts and see for yourself Smart money tends to follow big money If institutions are dumping shares this week we can expect to see much more red before green
MechaGZ_rules,,2019-05-20 15:39:00,3.828,CPRX that 398 wall was stronger than the one in GOT Had to scratch out while out during lunchtime Keeping on radar Probably should have waited for the 4 break and not entered during lunch trading

Stoic,True,2019-05-20 13:05:00,3.945,CPRX Seems theyre really defending the 4 mark on L2 Maybe theyll let it run EOD But today feels like a victory regardless as its started to break into the gap Remember that Constance Capital accumulated 85 million more shares last quarter at an average of 510 and I wouldnt be surprised if they and others continue accumulating at this discount putting pressure to the upside

Investbythenumbers,True,2019-05-20 10:25:00,3.853,CPRX As I have said before I am not surprised if we are here for a few more trading days as this is the top end of the initial drop If the Company utters the words we do not believe that our business model will be materially effected by the approval of Ruzurgi then we will most likely go right back to 6 as we would probably be around 12 without this approval
