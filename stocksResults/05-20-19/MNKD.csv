eddomovit,,2019-05-20 11:33:00,1.309,MNKD Fans of Castagna must be suffering from Stockholm SyndromeWhos making money here execs companies that help dilute Deerfield etc Dilute squander steal and shares from shareholders is not a recipe for success This is not a matter for tweaking We need a revolution Afrezza is not selling because the research is insufficient to cause an endo to switch from injectable Existing research shows Afrezza does not lower A1C compared with existing injectables MNKD has not promoted less hypos enough to motivate endos to switch MNKD has failed to convince endos Without enough endos onside the insurers will not budge To believe endos are not willing to become informed is nonsense There is not enough to become informed about Wasting 10 Million on useless ads when that could have been invested in research using CGMs with sufficient patients and duration
laborer75,,2019-05-20 11:26:00,1.304,MNKD UMD82 says the Christmas dilution was brilliant Also blames Deerfield for the SP That should be enough for anyone to see UMD82 is a dumbass I believe we could have did the offering at a much higher price if we waited Just my opinion Also blaming Deerfield for everything is some funny shit Deerfield does not control Mannkind just because we owe them some cash UMD82 is implying Castagna is in Deerfields pocket and taking orders from them UMD82 go get your shine box idiot
CommonOrdinaryYokel,,2019-05-20 11:16:00,1.299,MNKD If it finally takes off and never returns to this price level again then Ill feel good about the number of shares that I hold And if it does so somewhat rapidly then Ill also feel good about the number of January 2020 calls that I hold But if it declines further then I just might need to buy more of both
