CaptainSeely,,2019-05-20 15:53:00,352.986,BA Today I had a wonderful opportunity to take part in some simulator testing with Air Canada here in Toronto For the past week just about 100 pilots have been testing the 737 with MCAS we reenacted the situation with Air Ethiopia even with different weather conditions The results me and all other pilots fully recovered the aircraft And yes from the same altitude In fact many of us never even got to the nosedive over 80 were able to maintain full function of aircraft the entire time Regardless we all recovered You wont hear about this on the news As Boeing is closing in on this entire situation media is trying once more to keep the spotlight on Boeing I wonder how many hours Ethiopia pilots have been in simulators since the accident
