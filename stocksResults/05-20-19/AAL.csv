RalphCanine,,2019-05-20 11:14:00,30.784,AAL after merging with US Air in 2013 it was 25 per share with 730M shares outstanding for a market value of 1825B They bought back almost 290M shares and now have 444M Based on Fridays close of 3175 it was worth 141B So 5 years after the merger it has lost 4B in value despite almost 290M less shares Assuming AAL buys back no shares at 26 and 444M shares AAL would be valued at 115B According to Morgan Stanly this will lose 26B in value in the next year Does that smell like BS to anyone else
