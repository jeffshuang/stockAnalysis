HigherViberation,,2019-05-20 13:36:00,5.377,CVM There were suits in the meeting I would expect nothing less of huge manipulation and large entries If ya cant beat em join em But on the dips
Weedkiller420,True,2019-05-20 13:32:00,5.37,CVM geert told me he believes volatility is shorts working for tutes to get in
kjkjkjkjkj,,2019-05-20 13:30:00,5.399,CVM amazing to see longs and shorts fighting over the support level of 535
FatNinjaRider,,2019-05-20 13:26:00,5.42,CVM This is the bounce that takes it below 5
Weedkiller420,True,2019-05-20 13:20:00,5.43,CVM knowing there have been offers is comforting to me

HigherViberation,True,2019-05-20 12:51:00,5.358,CVM It was mentioned that very large investors have the potential to pull the price down to make a larger entry at a lower price There is Market Manipulation at play but the ONLY think that matters is the end results
