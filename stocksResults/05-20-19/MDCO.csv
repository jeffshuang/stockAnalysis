sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 13:26:00,34.195,MDCOand it is UP 100 from last Nov when short mafia was holding it down then too
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 13:25:00,34.2,MDCO historically when there has been VERY good news andor positive data like this past weekends data and the fundamentals supported a big move higher the short mafia has held the stock downdeja vu Short mafia was holding it down at 17 after good news came out and theyre doing it again today at 34 Its very frustrating but it is one of the BEST ideas out there IMO

sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 12:55:00,34.18,MDCO just noticing that one analyst raised his target price to 110 from 80 I am not sure if that was done today or on Friday source Factset I cant tell which firm made that change restricted from seeing it expect more target prices to be raised
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 12:15:00,34.569,MDCO this wont be a 5 Bil buyout when it happens IMO its more likely a 810 Bil deal
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 11:49:00,34.302,MDCO just looks at who owns it Fidelity owns 147 of OS 109 Mil shs Wellington owns 139 OS 103 Mil shsmeanwhile 275 of the float is short equates to 194 mil shs
zrumi,True,2019-05-20 11:45:00,34.33,MDCO please show me a nice squeeze to 41 today
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 11:42:00,34.021,MDCO note the market cap is only 25 Bil that is WAY TOO LOW for a product like Inclisiran mark my words
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 11:35:00,34.113,MDCO new data validates Inclisiran and then some theres been HUGE insider buying 19 Mil shs since October and an insider bought 50 mil of a convert that converts into shares too Eventually this has potential for this to blow the shorts up in a HUGE way bc of great data and a buyout which is likely later this year if Ph3 meets endpoint everything looks great so far and smart money insider has backed up the truck to load up on this stock He is promoting the buyout and has a world class drug that he knows BIG cap pharma andor Biotech will be all over it and a bidding war is possible

sell1buy2,True,2019-05-20 10:49:00,33.36,MDCO extremely positive data re Inclisiran remember this is clearly a buyout candidate too todays action smells of HFTs and shorts Note the shorts have attacked this name for years the data validates that this drug could be a BLOCKBUSTER O would not be surprised to see target prices raised and MA chatter begin to heat up just personal opinion EXTREMELY bullish on this name been involved for past 3 years following it closely
