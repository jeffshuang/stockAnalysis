Aaahchooo,,2019-05-20 14:39:00,0.5865,CYTR Maybe someone can explain the floor and ceiling on the share price in regards to the OTC potential If it was not on some planned lock on price we would be seeing a different behavior Also nants have not faired too well lately and are due for a news flash which can coincide with CYTR activities as well

dannymac65,,2019-05-20 11:20:00,0.59,CYTR I honestly believe reverse merger is off the table One of the biggest things of value to one of the parties involved is being able to be listed on a major exchange Since we are going over the counterthat is another reason to believe a deal has been already agreed to A Nasdaq listing carries tremendous value to an unlisted company

Hunter1099,,2019-05-20 09:58:00,0.5785,CYTR If SK EC let this go to OTC without filing an extension it truly means he has something up his sleeves bad intentions I truly dont think we will not notice a difference on OTC then what we have now EC SK have out right lied to us all they keep everything secret and no real updates any way The pumpers are spouting the same bull Sht as the spouted over the last 7 years Ive been in this just under different names
