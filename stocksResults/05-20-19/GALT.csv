Savinglives99,True,2019-05-20 14:01:00,4.559,GALT homework was done by the DU bulldozer before entry into this phase for the comp much agreed inst Involvement was ideal and DU did his homework with them to see if they would overreach in there buying of the RO all positive feedback would seem to be very clear as mngmt proceeded in this path and please pot pie it doesnt take a very astute businessman to figure this out The gentleman was giving smallholders a chance first then opening up to the big boys after the completion date Just a man of integrity and very much a throw back to old fashioned true honest virtues and values of the mid west Mr DU

charlesharvie,,2019-05-20 13:04:00,4.59,GALT While its nice for the common investor to have access to RO the real value for this is with the institutions We will know pretty quickly after the deadline if it was a bust or not Im pretty sure Uhline will fund this thing to completion either way but would be nice to see additional institutions on board Definitely would like to see this thing climb higher to maximize raise to company

kylesimpleton,,2019-05-20 11:12:00,4.524,GALT scary week for fanboys I think the RO has been a bust Notice most all posters on this board that have claimed to subscribe had a hard time understanding it after weeks and multiple explanations and then boasted of their minuscule amounts This is not meant to belittle anyones investment merely to point out that the small amounts are not going to get the company 70 million Unfortunately longterm investors in this company fall into three categories 1 newbies to investing very unsavory2 overinvested and cannot afford anymore3 My category fed up investor not willing to invest another dollar into this mismanaged company without at least a phase 3 protocolAs far as New investors anyone with half a brain is not going to invest in the RO with its crappy terms knowing the high likelihood of a second round of dilution immediately following and no FDA approved phase 3 protocol
Scarliver,,2019-05-20 10:12:00,4.49,GALT Heres an analogy Albert Einstein is to Physics as Scott Friedman is to NAFLDNASH Disregard anyone on the FDA panel No one can come close to him And remember he called GALT s data UNPRECEDENTED I dont care if it was 18 months ago its still unprecedented and if anything competition failure makes it even more impressive
Scarliver,,2019-05-20 10:06:00,4.52,GALT Always follow Scott Friedman He likes CANF he also likes GALT Called GALT unprecedented
