JD112,,2019-05-20 15:59:00,1.145,PTI Most of you are just penny flippers So let me tell you whats actually gonna happen with this since Ive been watching for over a year The triplet is the promising drug It shows no plateauing in the 14 day trials So 28 day will probably be promising The 28 days will finish in December with a 80 chance for success in my opinion In December or January they will announce results If the results are good this goes 10 easily If they are bad this stays about where it is maybe a little lower But until December I doubt this moves above 15 If the triplet fails they are basically done for as a company
