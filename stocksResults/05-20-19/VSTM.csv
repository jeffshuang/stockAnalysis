BobBenson,True,2019-05-20 10:14:00,1.52,VSTM WOW shorts are starting to see that they are stuck Only move is upward with their massive position If stock price drops short bag holders move in quickly to cover and get out causing the stock to rise back to even or up a few pennies So we live in an upward trend line of a few pennies until the next news release then move upward 1520 centsThis time next year this stock is easy over 750share Ill hold and watch my investment grow 300year Cheers
