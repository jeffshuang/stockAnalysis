Tilran,,2019-05-20 11:20:00,1.655,OCN 167 broken OCN might be in funeral mode here
Tilran,,2019-05-20 10:49:00,1.68,OCN the strongest support OCN has is 167 and it is testing it today over and over Obviously the China tradewar hurting the market overall isnt helpingbut we are also out of big fish trying to save OCN now It is nearly 11am EST and OCN is sitting at 25K shares traded The stock seems to have faded away and no one wants to touch it OCN management need to make a decision here on how they plan to protect Shareholder value They need to either reverse split the stock into a value that is no longer considered a penny stock I would think doing a 61 rs would be enough or they need to aggressively buy up the stock with repurchasing like ASPS loves to do Buy this back up to at least 3 and the investors will flood back in
