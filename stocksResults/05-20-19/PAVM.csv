Ap399,,2019-05-20 11:30:00,1.073,PAVM a very strong carpx update today but the timing is extremely curious Could it be they wanted to announce carpx update today and focus solely on eso nextflo and disappear tomorrow Possibly a big surprise Impossible to predict at this point I do not see any further delays other than the ones that we already knew were coming with further procedures and the 90 day review period for carpx Eso shouldnt have any delays and all other devices are progressing on schedule This update is curious in timing for sure though Definitely even more anxious to hear tomorrows update now
