zzxyz,,2019-05-20 13:23:00,2.572,SOLO Going over the bumper to bumper accident I mentioned below the weight of the delivery van far exceeded my car hence my car took the brunt of the bumper to bumper impact But if it was a Solo in the front the table turned for Solo to take the brunt of the impact due to its much lighter weight My biggest fear would be that the Solo lightweight allowed the force of the impact to propel the EV into the middle of the intersection This could be a dangerous situation especially when the yellow light turned into red and the cross traffic had the green light on
zzxyz,,2019-05-20 12:56:00,2.58,SOLO Im curious if the company has sold the 20 Solo they took delivery in March Los Angeles is a big city with a lot of freeways Im wondering if enough brave souls are willing to drive the Solo on the freeways On a side note not too long ago I had a bumper to bumper accident because the guy in the front slammed on the brake after changing his mind to run the yellow light Luckily the delivery van rear bumper did not suffer damage even on the bumper Unfortunately the plastic part of my front bumper broke into several pieces in the center What if it was a Solo that changed its mind about running the yellow light What if my car slammed on the solo rear bumper because of the sudden stop Will there be a personal injury to the Solo driver Will the Solo be pushed to the center of the intersection When we see a motorcycle we tend to give them a wide berth to avoid knocking them down by accident but with the Solo do we see a car or a motorcycle
