TalonStrike,,2019-05-20 13:40:00,41.267,SMAR continues to hold the bottom of LT Ascend Chnl 40 to 51 Nice look below the 50d MA that failed today is bullish along with the near term bullish wedge ER may be catalyst for next move higher SP near bottom of channel mitigates expectation risk which hurt the stk last ER price was too high pre ER
ure300,,2019-05-20 11:09:00,40.484,SMAR sub 40 soon
