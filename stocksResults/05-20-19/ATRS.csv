EusebioJL,,2019-05-20 12:42:00,2.78,ATRS reminder that if you have not voted yet vote against reelecting board members and against insider comp package this mgmt and board will award themselves stock and erode your position every year if you let them
Harry71,,2019-05-20 11:41:00,2.761,ATRS ADMP down 10
abdighaemmaghami,,2019-05-20 10:53:00,2.75,ATRS at this rate ATRS is lucky to hit 290 in 69 month No one has any confidence in the management right now
EusebioJL,,2019-05-20 10:43:00,2.71,ATRS tbh at this point TEVA looks to be the better investment their rebound will be swifter and likely to get 50 return in 6 months ATRS might hit 350 in 6 months and that seems like a big might at this point
EusebioJL,,2019-05-20 10:17:00,2.71,ATRS someone clearly threw in the towel this morning or this is more selling from Gonella at this point which does not need to be reported anymore probably part of the reason he was asked to step down so insider selling does not appear so rampant do look forward to seeing some Form 4s from insider buying Apple Powell should certainly love these prices no
abdighaemmaghami,,2019-05-20 09:43:00,2.745,ATRS this junk wont move unless management steps up doesnt matter what the market does this junk goes down either way3 is a dream now
everythingcopacetic,,2019-05-20 09:41:00,2.744,ATRS Im honestly just surprised with the movement of this Im holding for another year but if I get no good movement I may try to take advantage of something else Been 2 years now up 50 overall but that was over 100 at a point
