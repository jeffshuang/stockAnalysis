jedi_delta,,2019-05-20 14:06:00,8.398,VKTX Ive been researching for any negative about Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta agonists and cant find any Many potential Rx may treat NASH symptoms ballooning fibrosis with varying success BUT it seems only THRB agonists are the only class of Rxs that treats the UNDERLYING DISEASE in NASH Researchers and Docs recognize that liver fibrosis will decrease over time after NASH resolves ie the liver heals itself similar to fibrosis reduction from liver regeneration after cure of HepC or HCV Even researching it when it was called by another name Before it was bought from Ligand Pharma VK2809 was called MB07811 which was discovered by Metabasis Therapeutics Metabasis was purchased by Ligand infoheporgThyroidhormone
Tom63pa,,2019-05-20 13:27:00,8.424,VKTX I find it interesting that VKTX is up 10 percent for the year and MDGL is down 10 percent for the year
Hetorki,True,2019-05-20 13:08:00,8.437,VKTX this is ridiculously undervalued when it pops it gonna burn everything in its way up
VK2809orBust,True,2019-05-20 12:21:00,8.41,VKTX looks really good
jedi_delta,,2019-05-20 11:55:00,8.38,VKTX So the efficaciousness of VK2809 data was NOT just on healthier NAFLD F0F1 patients but also on F2F3 NASH patients too
jedi_delta,,2019-05-20 11:52:00,8.403,VKTX Key takeaway here is that VK2809 now appears not only to be a viable NASH candidate but it could be a bestinclass medicine to boot considering how well it did vs similar trial by MGL3196 Recall CEO Lian stated emphatically that he was confident that there were numerous NASH patients in the Ph2a trial

jedi_delta,,2019-05-20 11:41:00,8.34,VKTX Dr Friedman MD Mt Sinai School of Med says As most clinicians know patients with NASH have a systemic disease of metabolic syndrome with hyperlipidemia and in fact the leading cause of death in patients is cardiovascular disease so drugs that can improve the lipid profile at the same time as they can improve the fat content in the liver are especially appealing
jedi_delta,,2019-05-20 11:38:00,8.335,VKTX Examining safety there was no significant difference between the treatment arms no serious adverse events in any arm and excellent GI tolerability Loomba noted
jedi_delta,,2019-05-20 11:35:00,8.34,VKTX Dr Rohit Loomba MD UCSD explained that beta receptors play a key role in lipid metabolism but that the receptor is localized to the liver with invivo evidence suggesting that beta activation provides antifibrotic effects Speaking about VK2809 Loomba explained An agent that reduces liver fat improves systemic lipids and antagonizes fibrotic signaling could provide multipronged benefits in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH Loomba goes on to say Moreover this novel prodrug has good liver selectivity he added with preclinical models showing an accumulation of the drug primarily in the liver not the heart or brain medpagetodaycommeetingcov
