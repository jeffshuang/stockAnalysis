ECerus,,2019-05-20 14:13:00,0.9699,LTBR Personally I believe its illogical to even imagine that SethLTBR BODMgt TeamEnfission BODMgt Team have concocted a brew of MOUs and nonrevenue producing milestones if I understand that construct as a subterfuge to hoax the stockholders Other than no one at LTBR or Enfission or Framatome has he power to sign a proxy contract for Exelon or regulate the NRCs licensing or cast a DoE FOA vote what other magic can be performed Then Enfission is to blameI believe the BOD would shake their collective heads Rhetorical question as there is no honest answer So the entire Enfission team has been duped or is complicate and all we are seeing is WW2 era camouflage balloons FRED is quite the hypnotist Its been 15 years since Ive blocked him I have that to be grateful forClosing my mouth as my jaw is done dropping
tradeintherain,,2019-05-20 14:11:00,0.9699,LTBR There are no markets There are only perception managements Anything can be made to look as good or as bad as those who print money from nothing want them to be Hard currency money backed by basket of commodities will make the fraud obvious First country who returns to a gold standard or similar wins
fred54,,2019-05-20 12:42:00,0.9685,LTBR can we discuss again about the pros and cons of last DOE rejection letter At first I thought it a glowing rejection but I reread it and that Con about insufficient progress or evidence that the fuel would have a LTR by 2021 and commercialization by 2025 I find this really disturbing as beyond the GAIN news we know of nothing they have done to support the DOE timeline I mean not even a mock rod let alone a 3 meter one What confidence can anyone have that the result this time is different
BusinessClass,,2019-05-20 11:50:00,0.9652,LTBR The market is clearly telling us nonrevenue producing milestones are insufficient to increase shareholder value even if Seth wishes it were otherwise While these things may position us for future greatness the problem is the future is now I agree with Fred that a DOE grant is most likely the only catalyst that can raise the price for the foreseeable future and furthermore is a required catalyst to unlock all these other potentialities Seth has served us as mouthwater Hors doeuvre as we perpetually wait for greatness in the Lightbridge bardo Though Seth has peaked my interest with his smoke and mirrors Ive longed believed this is the case Buy sell hold I think were range bound until and if news leaks about the DOE grant Its not the best odds but I do think theyll get that grant And Im going to use this Seth Grae owl father incompetence window thats weighing on the price to pick up some more shares But Caveat Emptor my friends
fred54,,2019-05-20 09:50:00,0.98,LTBR i always worry when LTBR announces fluff instead of substance The playbook reads hes hedging against a no from DOE Regardless hes announced all he said from CC and its amounted to 0 I hope this is not substitute news for no utility K and no DOE grant
BusinessClass,,2019-05-20 09:46:00,1,LTBR well we knew this was coming and its good news but its still shuffling around chess pieces We need money more than advice and letters of interest without dollars
