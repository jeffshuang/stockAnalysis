TesttheWaters,,2019-06-05 15:16:00,3.52,CPRX Anyone who thinks Jacobus is a competitor or an issue at this point is crazy You really think theyre going to spend millions to market to 11 patients Nope not going to happen Theyll fade away having had their 15 minutes

arang,,2019-06-05 12:41:00,3.51,CPRX I guess people are not expecting that much from tomorrow meeting at all Not even a littlittle bit
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-05 11:15:00,3.502,CPRX Considering Jacobus will need to set up a GoFundMe page to even be able to market their drug Id say were probably ok
keremoner,True,2019-06-05 11:03:00,3.51,CPRX If i were longs which I am I would not pay attention to any of these meaningless price actions on low volume these days Nothing significant will happen until Jacobus announces their plans for their drug Jacobus likely will not market their drugs to other than the handful of juvenile patients and physicians will likely not prescribe it to adults as the average cost of Firdapse to adult patients is extremely affordable Insurance companies have little say in this and they likely would rather cover the costs for Firdapse than open themselves to lawsuits should anything go wrong Remember that the FDA did not approve the Jacobus drug for anyone other than children Then we fly Patience will be rewarded Huge upside here
