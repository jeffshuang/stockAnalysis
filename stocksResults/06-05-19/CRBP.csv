Bambiliveson,,2019-06-05 12:57:00,6.911,CRBP What you have here is shareholder fatigue Investors cant make money in this name No one wants to hear its 35 years away Ive never seen a management company so successful in hitting deadlines raising money both nondilutive and dilutive and doing things almost mistake free but at the same time they cant sell the story to one person Thats a red flag Bring on someone who understands the markets and can sell the story No one believes the current management regardless of them raising money the correct way and advancing programs The short will be here through the approval and then through the sales Its tough to go at this alone If they cant sell this story how will they sell the drug
