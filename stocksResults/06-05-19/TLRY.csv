pellegrino338,,2019-06-05 15:32:00,35.441,TLRY Given their financial condition and operating margins Im thinking the secondary could be priced in the 1218 range question is how does Privateer pull off their profit taking Theoretically has to occur before or with the secondary No institutional fund would touch this without that issue resolved Kennedys allegiance likely resides with privateer as it represents a once in a lifetime payoff

pellegrino338,,2019-06-05 13:15:00,35.735,TLRY Honest question for the bulls if youre bullish on the LT prospects of the company why not just wait and buy after dilution and Privateers price killing liquidation If you want to own at 35 why not wait and pick it up at 15 20 25 The company is beginning a de facto roadshow this week with the conferences which will lead to the inevitable dilutive secondary two major negative catalysts are on the horizon that are a matter of when not if I would not be surprised if they go the route of a blended direct offering that sells from the capital stock of TLRY and Privateers holdings just look at the price action after lockup when only a few small holders began liquidating in January Last point look at latest 13F filings All major institutional have liquidated their positions No new funds coming in What does that tell you
