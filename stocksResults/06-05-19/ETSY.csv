wintershere,True,2019-06-05 14:18:00,61.624,ETSY we have some people worried about the trade wars holding ETSY down Flaw with that is ETSY is not dependent on china like AMZN EBAY WMT etc are Once analysts realize that this platform and their sellers are different and have nothing to do with China or Mexico we should see a big rebound Perhaps people fleeing from those other names to the safety of ETSY
