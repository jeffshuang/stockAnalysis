FullSpectrumChicago,True,2019-06-05 10:33:00,1.49,SNES IMHO News very soon to come will be picking up volume The dust is settling across the markets bounces are occurring and folks are going for the low fruit and ripe droppings ie the best that can buy This is a great ticker at a great price I think anything between 1462 is a good purchase for this critter This is a long hold ticker that will likely see 2 or more by August at Q2 IF the news is great Im thinking 4 by the end of the year maybe more But if theyre having mass deployment in DC already and dates in Malaysia and New Zealand for this year alone think about it plusThere is a ton of eggs in several baskets if you do some research so things are going to hatch This board is strong because folks here do their homework and share it and thats part of what it takes to be part of the Rat PackIn the meantime those catching up on doing some DD Heres the earnings call transcript on Q1 GLTA seekingalphacomarticle42
