Michael_Hunt,True,2019-06-05 15:39:00,9.493,XERS in at 948 for the bounce If this drop had anything to do with bad news for Monday leaking the volume would be 22M not 224k Just a shake out Back to 10 by close
murahrah,,2019-06-05 15:38:00,9.468,XERS Well if it does get approved maybe itll even get to where it was at 830 this morning
murahrah,,2019-06-05 15:32:00,9.516,XERS All those smart institutions dont look so smart anymore
somaholiday,,2019-06-05 15:28:00,9.648,XERS one thing is certain next week the volume will be much more than 235k shares If such a tiny percentage of the outstanding shares can drop the price so much I am very curious to see how much the price rises on heavy volume with FDA approval
shummy,,2019-06-05 15:25:00,9.712,XERS this isnt rocket science guys either a manufacturing crl which will be chance to double down huge or its a fake outBlock the idiot troll he knows nothing about comp or balance sheet
murahrah,,2019-06-05 15:07:00,9.698,XERS I would have thought the institutions would have stepped in below 10 Evidently they too see the writing on the wall
shummy,,2019-06-05 15:00:00,9.695,XERS i went through alna and hrtx both did same before news and it was split 5050 could be manipulation could be a crlWe will know soon enoughAgain always manage risk
shummy,,2019-06-05 14:51:00,9.72,XERS they have 147 mil on hand Ok stop with the needing cashAt most there is an issue with manufacturingU didnt read about one trial or see any data just its selling off give it a break i am not in huge and i hope it get approval always manage risk but know what u r talking about dude
shummy,,2019-06-05 14:49:00,9.72,XERS balance sheetFyi mr muhahah
murahrah,,2019-06-05 14:44:00,9.735,XERS Furthermore the stock hasnt even attempted a recovery It is going straight down which means there isnt one single invidivual or institiution who is willing to invest in this
murahrah,,2019-06-05 14:29:00,9.735,XERS Hate to be one of these institutions that just bought at 10 They drank the Kool Aid
bitesize,,2019-06-05 14:28:00,9.735,XERS Wow so much fearmongering on here Seeing every single old trick in the book FDA rejection must have leaked they never would have raised equity if they thought they were getting approved shorts are manipulating the stock
murahrah,,2019-06-05 14:23:00,9.702,XERS Just did it again Put in the big sell and take it away stock falls
Sprackillac,True,2019-06-05 14:19:00,9.9,XERS 04 more and Im officially a bag holderwanted to swing this but looks like Im in until decision
nvera,True,2019-06-05 14:17:00,9.9,XERS This is going the wrong way I doubt that FDA disapproval could leak out The volume would tell us Must be jitters Doesnt take much to move these small float stocks
murahrah,,2019-06-05 14:15:00,9.883,XERS One other thing they never would have raised equity at 10 if they thought they were getting approved
Jamiesutto,,2019-06-05 14:13:00,9.91,XERS this is sad I dont have THAT many shares so it doesnt hurt but rather medically I hoped this would go through Could be the beginning of some serious breakthroughs for diabetes treatment yes I am a doc and I bought in due to the science and potential rather than the economics
somaholiday,,2019-06-05 14:10:00,9.931,XERS no worries PDUFA date is Monday It will either rip or dip I will be on board for the rip If it dips the sun will still shine life will go on all is good
murahrah,,2019-06-05 14:01:00,9.94,XERS All you have to do is put a large sell order and it pushes lower I am not even getting my sell offers and its goes lower and lower So easy
murahrah,,2019-06-05 13:59:00,9.882,XERS Remember the markets are up 700 pts in 2 days
murahrah,,2019-06-05 13:58:00,9.948,XERS Timber
murahrah,,2019-06-05 13:54:00,10.005,XERS This is shockingly easy And to think its going down at least another 30 by no later than Monday
murahrah,,2019-06-05 13:47:00,10.024,XERS Glad the markets up Could you imagine
murahrah,,2019-06-05 13:41:00,10.024,XERS There is some massive denial going on here Down 10 people and it has even been denied yet Yikes
Jamiesutto,,2019-06-05 13:38:00,10.116,XERS wtf is going on
somaholiday,,2019-06-05 13:33:00,10.116,XERS The drug here is a glucogen in the form of a roomtemp stable liquid Novel medium for a basic drug The delivery device GPen is a selfadministered singledose injection of the liquid glucogen 99 of Phase 3 study participants successfully administered a full glucagon dose with the GPen compared to only 6 31 of those using standard glucagon kits Of course there is a risk FDA issues a CRL but compared to the risk for the average NDA this is a pretty good bet for approval
joanna1993,,2019-06-05 12:55:00,10.03,XERS the final profit taking from a 1279 high
shummy,True,2019-06-05 12:39:00,10,XERS i will say i dont disagree with muhaha dude he shorted ttoo very wellBut i do disagree that there is no reason not to approve other than a manufacturing issue ect and yes there are leaks out of the fda and shorts do know better sometimesI still believe long
shummy,True,2019-06-05 12:22:00,10.2,XERS the short vol is concerningIf we get a crl it just means double downthere is nothing wrong with the scienceLong term
Mannix1961,True,2019-06-05 12:05:00,10.345,XERS I think Shorts have had their best day strongly recommend they start covering
MrTradeCraft,,2019-06-05 11:58:00,10.25,XERS Next pivot is 957 and Ill take it if it goes under 10
joanna1993,,2019-06-05 11:45:00,10.177,XERS anyone think well hear the news on Fridaymight wait to buy more till then
murahrah,,2019-06-05 11:45:00,10.177,XERS So no Longs are buying And Shorts are adding That doesnt tell you anything Clearly no one things they are getting approved and probably shorts have insider info Why fight the truth
Mannix1961,True,2019-06-05 11:43:00,10.209,XERS Must admit the price action is disappointing but not surprising as I expectedthe shorts to pounce on this stock Still think we can pull through this by Monday
murahrah,,2019-06-05 11:36:00,10.25,XERS Too Easy
Mannix1961,True,2019-06-05 11:08:00,10.475,XERS I see no hedge fund or Institutional selling which Again leads me to believe the Selling has to be Short Sellers driving down price in a thinly traded stock which is not widely followed The stock drop gets exaggerated by small trades and hence a short seller selling 10000 shares or 1000 shares every 10 min can cause a 50c drop in price It could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days for market forces to correct the price Hang it there Longs Monday will be exciting Soon we will be talking about 2020 potential sales
Mannix1961,True,2019-06-05 11:02:00,10.36,XERS RBC has a 24 price target
joanna1993,,2019-06-05 10:48:00,10.465,XERS only the pumpers getting off before the data
