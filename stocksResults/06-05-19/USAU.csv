3d3,True,2019-06-05 12:22:00,1.037,USAU nothing has changed in the company since it quotes between 140 and 150 It is very cheap perhaps some shareholders who have some information sold with the intention of scaring new shareholders and thus buy back what they sold This should cost much more than 150 inclusive Its time to buy with gold rising too

allsport,,2019-06-05 10:46:00,1.04,USAU Btw at the time of this post we just traded at 103 I am not worried and I am not trading this I am accumulating shares on days like this where the backdrop is extremely positive for metalsminers and you have 1 or 2 very weak hands selling because they have no idea what they own or what is happening overseas Watch Nonfarm on Friday could be what GLD needs to break thru coupled with the negative tariff talk
allsport,,2019-06-05 10:41:00,1.04,USAU Please read my past posts RE the tight share structure here that means fewer shares are available They only have 19mil shares out and EdDave own 17mil as of Q1 They also have a hedge fund long so when you do the math this is a stock you want to own when GLDGDXGDXJ rally as the shorts will get squeezed harder than in just about any other miner No doubt there has been a big seller starting in the 145153 range but this is the time you call IR or reread their May 10 news and buy more I just bought 23000 between 105110 due to GLDGDXGDXJ rally If you get gold to close monthly in June July or Aug above 1362 the shorts will run for the hills in ALL names At 1339 we are very very close Look at terrible housing s past 2 weeks and huge ADP miss today 27000 jobs vs 190000 estimate Explain to me how the Fed raises rates anytime soon
