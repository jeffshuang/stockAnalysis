Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-05 11:26:00,84.679,GALT I love it when these ICPT clowns come to the GALT board to boast about their overpriced ass itching drug that costs an arm and a leg Maybe I should just sell my liver to pay for the cost of Ocaliva The idiocy Congrats on the drug generating income yes fantastic but now you need to put on your business hat and think about how an insurance company can possibly entertain the outrageous costs associated with the infamous ass itching killer the manufacturing costs are too high and so are the drug costs Regardless of saving lives and treating the ill it is all about business and always will be Good luck with that battle 20k for three month supply Ill stick to my apple juice thats cheap to manufacture and does not make my ass itch Keep coming Ocaliva wrong board
