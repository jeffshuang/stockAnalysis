Lineau,,2019-06-05 14:58:00,1.79,ONCY Sold a lot today Made up the loss with my RWLK Will buy ONCY again lower to average down
aaron03,True,2019-06-05 14:52:00,1.79,ONCY Had to buy more shares with that dip Im confident that things will turn around for ONCY But no questionthis is the most frustrating stock that I own Everything points to a brighter future
aaron03,True,2019-06-05 14:22:00,1.775,ONCY I was wrong Unless a miracle happens in the last 90 minutes of tradingwe will end up red Unbelievable Todays volume is the highest since those backtoback days in April April 4th and 5th On those dayswe eclipsed 500K in volume I think we will get over 300K today There is no reason for it to be red Oh well
livelifenow,True,2019-06-05 14:08:00,1.78,ONCY points I remember are 1 live review of data during the 16 weeks which allows for quicker determination of verification 2 Ability to share data with other potential partners as it happens to attack new players to onc 3 Cost equally shared so no burden or cash issues since they already had this worked in 4 The unique reason why onc is preferred because its application is IV 5 The billion dollar opportunity space they expect to be part of They expect to go faster to the final stage from this trail I think people need to listen to the call and make there own decisions as a lot was said My opinion is this will get bought out and Im staying in either until 50 or 0
livelifenow,True,2019-06-05 13:37:00,1.79,ONCY on the call they explained that the ph3 was delayed as they focusing on the biomarker This will allow them to possibly speed up the ph3 This was the explanation
livelifenow,True,2019-06-05 13:35:00,1.79,ONCY there will be a partner bo thats for sure
Gringo444,,2019-06-05 13:18:00,1.8,ONCY 300K shares traded and it dropsWas it good news in their latest PR BULLISH I dont know anymore
Deviner,,2019-06-05 12:49:00,1.79,ONCY People must be seeing as I see the excuse of derisking the original phase 3 time after time again just means they really have no confidence that the original phase 3 would be successful

Seb10X,True,2019-06-05 11:33:00,1.761,ONCY I think it speaks volumes that Pfizer got onboard with ONCY again Pfizer could have easily said thanks but no thanks to collaborating with ONCY due to past history unless they felt confident in Matt and teams vision with pelareorep going forward Pfizer Merck Roche and BMSCelgene involved now
saxy4u,True,2019-06-05 11:19:00,1.79,ONCY Iron Lion and Scaman Shorties glad you didnt lose your shirts Even as shorties everyone should succeed Nice knowing you
Deviner,,2019-06-05 11:16:00,1.799,ONCY Just smells fishy First there is delay to phase 3 to do SOLTIWOO study Now they are saying this phase 2 is to support that phase 3 again It sounds to me like the original phase 3 is eventually going to be cancelled cause it keeps getting postponed by other earlier stage studies They are delayingeventually cancelling the original phase 3 without admitting it by replacing it with other studies
aaron03,True,2019-06-05 11:06:00,1.82,ONCY We will end green today The question is will we get over 2share by the end of today I say yes

saxy4u,True,2019-06-05 09:54:00,1.899,ONCY shorts covering before Tutes make decision at 11
Deviner,,2019-06-05 09:53:00,1.91,ONCY Is this another disguised delay of the breast cancer phase 3 Afterall we are going into another phase 2 and the presentation seems to show phase 3 is now in unknown timelines back in 2020
Deviner,,2019-06-05 09:48:00,1.93,ONCY I hate to be a party pooper but this is just a phase 2 study and we are sharing the costs It is not like a major partnership where partner provides big financing
