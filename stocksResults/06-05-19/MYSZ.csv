adeloach,True,2019-06-05 14:16:00,0.6675,MYSZ Only 27 trading days till compliance deadline No announcement of a shareholder vote for RS I think a heads up is required 24 days before holding a vote This tells me they dont consider a RS required

adeloach,True,2019-06-05 12:55:00,0.665,MYSZ I have looked at this situation from just about every angle Based on what we know I feel confident that we are in no danger of delisting I also dont believe a RS is not in our future Mysz is on the cusp of a major deal If it does not materialize before compliance deadline then their capitalization and signed agreements will be enough to obtain an extension I base this on reviewing dozens of other companies facing similar circumstances with Nasdaq
