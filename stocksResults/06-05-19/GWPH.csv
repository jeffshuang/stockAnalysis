PatLA818,,2019-06-05 15:43:00,177.723,ZYNE tempted to ad 250 more shares here just in case news is good The Zygel trials dont come due till later this year but they might say just enough to get this moving up again I suspect they will mention the FDA meeting last week as they presented but already know that GWPH sort of killed any possible momentum the CBD sector when they said that CBD possibly damaged the liver in thier research They have the only FDA approved CBD drug so that concerned the FDA It will be next year before FDA have enough evidence to set up regs for CBD Yet any good clinical trial news will make it easier to get drugs to the market Plus Canada is going to do thier version of the FDA approval for CBD in Oct That will put these American Bio pharmas in a good position too as they could license their drugs out as HEB did with Ampligen to Argentina recently regardless of what US FDA decides Its a big world out there and only reason US freaks out is over lawsuits People dying need this now
