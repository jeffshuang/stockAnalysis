ClayB,,2019-06-05 13:48:00,2.645,CLDX Im not as negative as some people on this board id I wish I sold last week and bought back Yes Has management done questionable things Yes In my opinion the pipeline is improving and has a real chance at success in the future Is dilution going to happen yes There will be plenty of time to buy and sell over the years to setup up for a future success

Growth,True,2019-06-05 11:08:00,2.578,CLDX MoonSniffer Ill repost my bullish stance from yesterday for all the weak stomachs out there1 Its trading far below cash on hand 6share cash on hand 2 Its a low floater low floaters lately have been going off for 100 3 They just presented encouraging data at Asco this past weekend 4 Has multiple price targets in the double digits and ran that high within past 6 months 5 Im really liking the chart set up hitting a double bottom from lows within the past 6 months and getting tight at the end of a falling wedge pattern The 250s were always possible and I have officially started scaling in small for a 2nd position here as promised if we reached the 250s My stance still stands as long as we dont have a clear break of 255 support and close below it Only sharing my DD and this is my opinion not advice Always do your own DD before buying a stock
