teamgreen,True,2019-06-05 15:33:00,6.475,AUPH tape says lin selling into buys easy to do low volume been doing it for awhilekeep it boundget a 100 bo pop easy on 56 8 up cuts in to percentage offers at THIS timejmo
HowdoIGRAPH,True,2019-06-05 15:32:00,6.475,AUPH you heard it folks I am back in full accumulation mode Ill start looking at other stocks for swings Spoke to some MDs on some tbe key points on this vs LN If this even comes close to what the read out was for p2 look out
skiesthelimit64,True,2019-06-05 15:30:00,6.481,AUPH This is obviously being shorted today I would also watch future put volume If we see an increase it may be time to rethink strategy as Iljin maybe taking some revenge
Mr_Feynman,True,2019-06-05 15:03:00,6.471,AUPH Besides for the childish vitriol from ILJIN what do people dislike about their proposals Im curious to hear opinions on both sides As of right now I am leaning to vote yellow however I have no issues with a 15 holder having a voice on the board 1 person Some dissent is healthy if they can keep it productive
Neil_Armstrong,,2019-06-05 14:10:00,6.503,AUPH ohhh btw he also laughed when brought up Robert foster being independent
humour,,2019-06-05 14:02:00,6.505,AUPH Imagine if Robert Foster believessuspects that Voc in P3 is not gonna show statistically enough difference over placebo different set of patients hence trying desperately to get on BOD to initiate the sale of the company if there are some low ball offers Better get something than nothing
Neil_Armstrong,,2019-06-05 13:53:00,6.525,AUPH lastly it is safe to assume a late novdec readout of data depending on if the last few patients want to do the extension study if they do then they need to do a 4 week follow up which will delay data readout a few weeks
Neil_Armstrong,,2019-06-05 13:52:00,6.527,AUPH SW IR this morning mmmhmmm asked most of the questions iwe originally wanted answered but i had a few other topics i wanted more info on TBH this is VERY lil because he can only give us so much info without it being insider info obvi anyways here are my short notesFSGS slow enrollment Assume final data wont be at least until Q3 2020 now Spoke about importance of IP extension since same dosageDES last study was really a p1b Potential GTM date of 20222023 so a while away from revenue generating Confident this can be a first line treatment With the size of the market Great opportunity If someone wants to pay to partner they would be willing Always in talksVoc the p2 was really a p3 Aurora is a confirmatory study so still very confidentILIJIN their strategy matches mgmts get most value called recent news head scratcher they thorougly vetted greenleaf so no issue thereAgreed with me that mgmt should buy more shares on common marketShow More

JPatrick1,,2019-06-05 13:21:00,6.525,AUPH It has been suggested that I buy a watch because its time
JPatrick1,,2019-06-05 13:17:00,6.54,AUPH Ive been watching this all day teetering back and forth up and down between 653 and 657 and feel like I may be getting sleepy or possibly duped into a hypnotic trance by some South Korean diabolical ploy

Bansky,,2019-06-05 12:40:00,6.565,AUPH Almost back in buy range
JPatrick1,,2019-06-05 12:36:00,6.55,AUPH All this talk about ILJIN makes me want to vomit The noise I make when puking sounds a lot like Hyuek Joon Lee
jarepeo,,2019-06-05 12:32:00,6.549,AUPH It looks like I could just buy any stock right now and watch it dribble down a scootch all day
PghKid1,True,2019-06-05 12:07:00,6.55,AMRN AUPH is my next target
r_csiszar,True,2019-06-05 11:55:00,6.545,AUPH feels like this week is dragging on Feels like an eternity wheres our well deserved BO or running up Keeping positive

Dream_Catcher,True,2019-06-05 11:15:00,6.54,AUPH How do we get Scott Gottlieb on the board He can do NEA and AUPH on the side and push for BO
Labelguy1122,True,2019-06-05 10:51:00,6.585,AUPH Looking good just need some good news to send us flying
JPatrick1,,2019-06-05 10:47:00,6.585,AUPH 1 hour and 10 minutes into the day trading volumes are at 80000 shares If youre trying to buy I understand why but if you want to sell ask at least 700 This will help the activity value and overall integrity of AUPH Its getting close to mid 2019 and high time to get things going only because I think so
StockTrader21,,2019-06-05 10:47:00,6.585,AUPH as I stated before all this doesnt and cant affect the valuation of VOC IN LN or FSGS in the market if approved
IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-06-05 10:39:00,6.6,AUPH I predict we are going to gradually move back up to high 6s Looks like we are slowly getting higher highs and higher lows again
JPatrick1,,2019-06-05 10:32:00,6.59,AUPH I think many of us forget the challenge it has been to get this drug approved to help all those suffering from Lupus The noble efforts by pioneers like Dr Glickman have been mitigated by International Manipulators and their self serving interests without regard to the investors who have faithfully contributed so much during this long journey
Lunacy,,2019-06-05 10:29:00,6.6,AUPH Pros cons of voting out Dr Hyuek Joon LeeHasnt he aligned himself with current Auph BOD Management over ILJINWho fills the empty seat if he gets voted out Possibly filled by another ILJIN nominee that is aligned with ILJIN or even Robert FosterIm open to a discussion on this
AuntMarie,True,2019-06-05 10:11:00,6.56,AUPH VOTING important if you are voting yellow you MUST NOT vote for Joon LeeILJN you must individually put him onto WITHHOLD VOTE so if you are using the automated form that comes to your accountyou MUST NOT say yes to ALL if you are not surejust ask on the board and someone will help you
LordDragon,True,2019-06-05 10:11:00,6.56,AUPH Given the amount of unrest surrounding ILJINs recent moves its always good to remember why we LONGS have been here all these years Allow me to share with you an the story of Auphieits an oldie but pertinent as everSorry about the lack of recent updates but you probably have been keeping up with them Enjoy docsgooglecomdocumentd
AuntMarie,True,2019-06-05 10:08:00,6.565,AUPH loli had to laugh at the 700 notation belowi am not selling for less than 4500 seriously
JPatrick1,,2019-06-05 10:00:00,6.555,AUPH Its obvious that low prices stagnate the trade volumes and allow institutional investors to step in and take increased ownership of AUPH and once this happens they will want to run the whole operations and make sure there demands are met DONT SELL FOR LESS THAN 700
Dream_Catcher,,2019-06-05 09:47:00,6.62,AUPH Remember to vote JOON LEE ILJIN out of his seat on the board
LordDragon,True,2019-06-05 09:45:00,6.65,AUPH GM Fam Lets get it on
UT_RPh,,2019-06-05 09:39:00,6.623,AUPH I mentioned yesterday that I think in the future that VOC would possibly be used in RA
