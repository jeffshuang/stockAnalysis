contrarianspeculator,,2019-06-05 13:36:00,4.394,JVA look for sales of 232 million and earnings of 3 cents when the company reports its second Q results this Monday That would represent a 5 increase in sales and a 66 drop in earnings Not too bad considering that coffee futures during the Q reached 20 year lows
DosGatos,,2019-06-05 12:50:00,4.363,JVA Cant even hold a 25 mil MC SAD
