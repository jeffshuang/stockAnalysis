Carson_The_Schnauzer,,2019-06-05 10:44:00,23.737,ANF finally with a PE of 11 this thing is fairly priced to its peers AEO URBN GPS etc If short I would cover here Not much more downside left in my opinion in the short term Long term more pain can come to retailers dependent on mall traffic The real story will be if they can continue increasing online sales and whether or not there will be further demand for this brand
