Susu_Rafraf,,2019-06-05 12:02:00,6.644,OBLN i did not play this call but if you refer to my posts I want you to see why my thinking was at 102 which was a perfectly timed bottom and why selling around 110 was reasonable It all has to do with the other investors who know 100 was the bottom If they know this and plan to play it then youll never get it at the very bottom and if it does manage to get to 1 even when theres so much protection at 102 then you know its likely going to drop further Just like with GNCA I didnt wait for it to touch the trend line at 532 but got in ahead of the full drop which is what you need to do as well You set up your lines as I show you in my videos ema and sma then you try to buy at protection NOT at the threshold of breaking The threshold of breaking should be where you sell if it breaks to minimize losses
