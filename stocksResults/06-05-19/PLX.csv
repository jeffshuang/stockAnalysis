BryGuy29,True,2019-06-05 11:30:00,0.365,PLX volume is insanely low for this stock Again I think its all just low exposure Investors just dont know Protalix Any bit of good news whether it be filing for AA or partnership this stock will explode greatly in just one day Pfizer and Chiesi are no idiots They wouldnt get involved if this company was a scam Patients will pay off here I may have been bad at my timing but Im usually correct about the end result Good luck to you all This year should be exciting to watch
