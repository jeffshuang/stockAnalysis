ptang,,2019-06-05 11:28:00,1.67,TTOO IMO these drops are not shorts but just longs selling shares from weak hands margin calls etc My bet is that the short interest spiked last half of May with last hit piece coordinated and now we are seeing fallout from breaking through the 250 level we had for months Nasdaq short interest for last half of May out next week so we will see would be too early to mount another hit piece at these levels so short manipulation is in wait and see mode
