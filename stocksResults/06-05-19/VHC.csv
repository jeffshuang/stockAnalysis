OPmoney,False,2019-06-05 14:29:00,6.23,VHC CAFC oral recording crux of matter even prodded and presented on a silver platter by judges to APPLE 4WIN In Short the recording basically states the primary argument is RPCbegins at 2042 USING RPC Examiner Cited page 4439 states further substantial evidence and Patent Owner contested and that argument was made the board understood that argument and rejected it The board found the evidence showed and supported this conclusion On appendix 28 to 29 we are still NOT persuaded by Patent owners argument for at least the reasons previously discussed judge asks on pg 11 pg 24 board discussedbla bla blah does that get you to that IS the explanation I think it is VirnetXs argument Virnetx making it linchpin of this case this material on page 27 28 and also 24 with regard to RPC is referenced considered AND Board was unpersuaded thats why the argument doesnt hold water at 2744 goes to claim 12 FAIL
WitchKingOfAngmar,True,2019-06-05 11:40:00,6.18,VHC I doubt anybody has a clue on when we can expect a decision on yesterdays hearing Although I think I know what it will be As far as being reflected in the share price this is typical of what happens to us when we get any news out of the court system Not that this was news anyway When havent we move up then back down Been a while But and heres the great thing When we get the decision out of the CAFC regarding en bank jmo this is going to have one of the MOASs Up Kinda like a one way shot to the stars No coming back Got a ticket GL

WannaMillion,True,2019-06-05 09:49:00,6.195,VHC Great summary and the end result is REMAND IMO
WannaMillion,True,2019-06-05 09:33:00,6.335,VHC Cisco responses are as if he is a deer in the headlights He is stunned and speechless repeating himself and in disbelief that he has nothing to make his argument stronger REMAND is in order
