sktrader1,,2019-06-05 10:47:00,11.283,AMC hey all my bulls Im sorry its going this way but I have to be honest this price action scares the crap out of me Normally this be easy to jump in before exdate at these levels and hold for some equity gain However this has been absurd and even when market melts up the stock falls As Benny implied its hard not to feel something is up My biggest concern with AMC is AList I said long ago this subscription program is not profitable Yes they manage the cost and doing better with execution than MP ever did but I dont feel they have found that sweet spot where shows up in the balance sheet Plus usage should be significantly higher this Q as well which hurts their ability to produce better margins on the program AMC cant afford another negative ER Will really drive a narrative for divi cut and Debt concerns will really fly Personally I wish they just raid it all up to 40 a month and be done with it Good luck all Its staying on sidelines for nowShow More
