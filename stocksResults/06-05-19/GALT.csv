StopaGE,False,2019-06-05 15:48:00,3.915,GALT Oh yeah DU this and DU that and stock down 10 from RO Great job POFS Stick to making cardboard and let someone else run this
Scarliver,,2019-06-05 14:45:00,3.9,GALT DU has been fixing his Bulldozer Almost ready to rip
OCH11,,2019-06-05 14:33:00,3.9,GALT GALT is in Rip Van Winkle mode Hopefully my kids or grandkids will reap the benefits of my foresight and patience
kylesimpleton,,2019-06-05 13:05:00,3.9,GALT lets see no CMO Management largest shareholder and BOD dumped shares high weak RO no Phase 3 protocol no update on FDA drug or repro tox but all this means a Buy Out For sure because they cant be that Incompetent
D_Coral,True,2019-06-05 12:36:00,3.888,GALT Current price is a gift to buyers who are accumulating and averaging down Company is in the strongest position ever and a NASH Phase 3 company wont be trading in the single digits thats for sure
Scarliver,,2019-06-05 12:34:00,3.88,GALT If there was no chance of a buyout 1 BackBay would be gone by now 2 A new CMO and management team would be in place for a Fall P3 start Nothing special came out of ASCO But we did learn some things Like in NASH checkpoint inhibitors wont do the job alone combinations are needed We also learned that checkpoint inhibition has a growing number of toxicities associated with therapy The Galectin 3 science continues to advance We have an inhibitor that is a safe therapy perfect for combination therapy both in NASH and in Immunooncology Good luck
Talon1,,2019-06-05 12:23:00,3.88,GALT News of any of these could come next week next year or the year after Between next week and next year is most likely Im patient
Talon1,True,2019-06-05 12:01:00,3.88,GALT Being concerned about share price in the absence of news about effectiveness partnership or buyout makes no sense if you believe in the science and are in for the long term as I am
StopaGE,False,2019-06-05 11:53:00,3.85,GALT Now down over 5 with no real bottom in sight
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-05 11:26:00,3.9,GALT I love it when these ICPT clowns come to the GALT board to boast about their overpriced ass itching drug that costs an arm and a leg Maybe I should just sell my liver to pay for the cost of Ocaliva The idiocy Congrats on the drug generating income yes fantastic but now you need to put on your business hat and think about how an insurance company can possibly entertain the outrageous costs associated with the infamous ass itching killer the manufacturing costs are too high and so are the drug costs Regardless of saving lives and treating the ill it is all about business and always will be Good luck with that battle 20k for three month supply Ill stick to my apple juice thats cheap to manufacture and does not make my ass itch Keep coming Ocaliva wrong board
scapinvestor,,2019-06-05 11:25:00,3.89,VKTX GALT Does anyone know anything about IMRN they have drugs in phase 2 for NASH Just did financing and is 60 off 52 wk high Definitely a micro cap but im thinking about getting in at the ground floor
chankr,True,2019-06-05 11:21:00,3.89,GALT loaded up on a few more here
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-05 11:06:00,3.92,GALT As per usual these drops have NOTHING to do with the fundamentals and actual science It is the overall market sentiment in play here If you cant weather it sell Not for the faint of heart So with that said BO UP
Boss530,False,2019-06-05 11:06:00,3.92,GALT dont worry guys Im sure youll catch up eventually
StopaGE,False,2019-06-05 10:54:00,3.901,GALT POFS is nose diving once again DU does not seem to be able to keep the price above 400 no matter what he does
Tigergalt,True,2019-06-05 10:54:00,3.901,GALT Clearly our SP has been down since the time of RO and continues falling Is this because the RO didnt raise enough money needed for p3 and probably second round of fund raising is needed Do we have enough money to fully cover the approval process
Bygtyme,True,2019-06-05 10:13:00,3.97,GALT is the DU trustee writing shareholder letters and really all of management is dead
Scarliver,,2019-06-05 09:34:00,4.07,GALT The NASH tipping point put out by ICPT see below just makes the case for GALT what we have been saying for several years now its Fibrosis not Fat that matters Thanks ICPT for making the case for GALT
