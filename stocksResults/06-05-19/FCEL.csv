audi65,,2019-06-05 10:39:00,1.02,FCEL Wow what a dumb ass PR right before their next ER Well at least the guessing game is over We know how their numbers are going to look when ER is finally released it most likely wont be good Could fall back into the 50 range by eof week if we dont hold a 1 here Then I will agree with some of the shorty posts that another RS is right around the corner This move could be the nail in the coffin for us true longs whove been here over a year now GLTA
Lenyo,,2019-06-05 10:37:00,1.034,FCEL laying off half your workforce and replacing that expenditure with a couple of suits is the most ridiculous thing Ive ever heard of

Lenyo,,2019-06-05 10:23:00,1.083,FCEL just to add some detail to stkrs post FCELB the preferred has just been cut in half 45
stkr,False,2019-06-05 10:20:00,1.081,FCEL I think this stock will do a new RS in July The stock price will approach as close to 0 as possible There will be no rise in stock prices due to factors other than RSLook atFCELB A great situation is happening Soon this ill effect will propagate to FCEL
Lenyo,,2019-06-05 10:20:00,1.081,FCEL Desperate times call for desperate measures what Im wondering is how does some consulting company with 0 experience in fuel cell commercial energy generation help complete projects that are a year behind schedule Answer they dont
audi65,,2019-06-05 10:20:00,1.081,FCEL ust as I feared with this PR Tanking hard now with pps under 110 now Wouldnt be surprised one bit we close under a 1 today Another move that does absolutely nothing to help out investors here from this incompetent BOD
JacquesP,,2019-06-05 10:17:00,1.081,FCEL are we cutting losses or what
Girba,False,2019-06-05 10:16:00,1.1,FCEL Going under 1 again
audi65,True,2019-06-05 10:10:00,1.12,FCEL Another piece of news that tanks us even more I guess longs shouldnt be surprised after umteen PRs that this company has released that does nothing but keep bringing pps down We were trading around 160 when BP news came out instead of sending us over 2 here we are around 110 BOD just keeps throwing darts at the wall to see what sticks at this point They just have no clue how turn this sinking ship around I havent given up but Im clearly disappointed frustrated where we currently stand IMO GLTA
sullivanmp18,False,2019-06-05 09:56:00,1.127,FCEL dammit Forced to sell 66 of my position at 115 I saw this same thing with RGSE will go down before any chance of going up Essentially they dont know how to move forward to pay debts Will selloff assets and probably dilute before another RS
audi65,True,2019-06-05 09:54:00,1.12,FCEL Not how we wanted to start the day folks Its still early though so I hope we can recover not go under 110 today Markets rarely like internal turmoil which appears to be the case with this kind of move JMHO
