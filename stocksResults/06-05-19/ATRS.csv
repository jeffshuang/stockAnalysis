TDFOR32,,2019-06-05 15:39:00,2.802,ATRS In my opinion it seems odd shares are being sold at these levels within the context of ATRS having reported rapidly increasing revenues for the last three quarterly financial reports the company having provided full year 2019 guidance of between 95 and 100 million dollars and the companys expectation of break even results during the fourth quarter of this year In light of the foregoing rapidly increasing revenues for three successive quarters full year 2019 guidance and the expectation of break even results in the 2019 fourth quarter if not sooner one might in my opinion reasonably conclude that the share price should be continuously rising
