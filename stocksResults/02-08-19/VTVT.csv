CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 13:47:00,2.644,VTVT To be clear on my position I am interested in the pattern setup on chart only so I am not looking to add this long term
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 12:35:00,2.68,VTVT Correction 265 entry not 165
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 12:20:00,2.654,VTVT I see 165 as entry level if you think a breakout is coming I do but that is my opinion Keep watch
b2dddub2,True,2019-02-08 12:15:00,2.63,VTVT On watch for 255 area to hold

CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 11:39:00,2.691,VTVT Basically the whole market is red and it is Friday so selling occurs I wouldnt panic with a slight drop in price Very low volume
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 11:37:00,2.696,VTVT Just to clarify Be safe when trading by setting a stop loss or at least a mental stop to exit position if losses occur Be smart
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 11:33:00,2.708,VTVT Anyone who is short on this will post negative outlook well because they profit when price declines I am just looking at chart
horst80,False,2019-02-08 10:24:00,2.687,VTVT time for this pig to implode without Mr P stock would trade below 10 cents
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 10:19:00,2.711,VTVT There you go that 270 good entry in my opinion
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 10:14:00,2.715,VTVT May be a very good day to get in at a price near recent support 265270
CzarCraze,True,2019-02-08 10:13:00,2.72,VTVT Slow here so far today Holding Low volume low range
