Sticks2222,,2019-05-28 15:05:00,0.719,NXTD they are going to pull the reverse stock split to get it back over 100 Like all the rest Reduce your shares They will run with it till it goes down below a dollar again They will keep making excuses until its just time to tell the truth This company just stinks Who wants to carry a coin in their pocket to tap and pay things when you can just use your phone with other lines of payment The same with a watch Who wears watches when your phone has the time and you can make payments from your phone Just terrible
DA500,,2019-05-28 14:51:00,0.719,NXTD Heres the statement made by Gino about the 2016 RS Gino Pereira Chief Executive Officer stated The reverse stock split will allow us to satisfy the NASDQ minimum share price requirement and cure the previously announced delisting issue relating to that requirement We also believe that the resulting increased price will make the Company more attractive to investors We continue to execute on our strategic plan and have confidence in our business and in the long term prospects of our Company
