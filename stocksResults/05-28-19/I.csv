PDJ,,2019-05-28 15:10:00,19.79,I SES LORL I All getting killed today I havent to this point read a good reason why Does anyone have any information or a hypothesis
DavidOrr,,2019-05-28 13:36:00,19.8,I So normalized net income for Telesat is about 200myear cash flows about double that LORLs share is 62 so about 125myear LORL really has a market cap of 11b but also nearly 300m in cash and tax assets So 800m adjusted market cap against a company earning 125myear Probably undervalued And their spectrum jackpot is just as good as IntelsatsInvestor relations arent picking up so Ive tried email I dont think I am missing anything though

DavidOrr,,2019-05-28 09:50:00,20.847,I Howdy friend bulls I found another company LORL that owns 62 of Telesat Telesat stands to receive about 15 the windfall amount that Intelsat does The underlying business is quite healthy Boiled down LORL trades at 6 times earnings and a discount to book value better on a cash flow basis With a market cap of just 700m it already has some upside without any windfall If Intelsat actually receives 20b LORL would receive about 2b effectively 4xing the market capIm going to call LORL investor relations today to make sure Im not missing anything and update
