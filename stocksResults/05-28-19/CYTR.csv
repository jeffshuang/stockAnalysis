Aaahchooo,,2019-05-28 13:02:00,0.5573,CYTR SK has 17M shares rolling to OTC as well which surprises me on the delist 874k if you remove options Rolling into OTC screwing SHs then being the only one to get rich sounds fraudulent and would definitely stand a chance in court I side with something else like BIOFROGAUNTIE and maybe PIETRO has said its not the price of the stock but the value of the science At this point in time what science CYTR has they have and you can only value what is in hand which is MS payments and a launch of LADR probably free to buyer so a few hundred million if all goes well and a sale at NPV not even equaling total All this to say OTC or 56 cents doesnt really matter at the end of the day itll be sold 715 dollar range and the rest will be history
mattwp125,,2019-05-28 12:46:00,0.56,CYTR crazy idea herewhat if Kman wanted to scare retail into selling by saying they are fine with going OTC This is to get stubborn longs to sell when they may actually file an extension Again just hoping
basherbuster,,2019-05-28 10:47:00,0.56,CYTR Well it appears to still be listed on the Nas Where is the Filing for extension Or delist notice if extension not being filed Way to keep everybody in limbo Steve
