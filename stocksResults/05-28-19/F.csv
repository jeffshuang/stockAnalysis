proton471,,2019-05-28 11:07:00,9.835,F GM SPY Think about this If ride sharing substantially reduces the total number of cars mfd the indirect costs of mfg will have to be spread across far fewer cars This means the selling price has to go up to maintain margin That will make the biz case for ride sharing more compelling and further reduce the number of cars sold Said another way the world will have far too much car mfg capacity and it will only get worse City dwellers who couldve afforded cars will be priced out and be forced to use taxis limos or ride sharing Rural ppl are just plain phuqd cuz there is no reasonably priced ride sharing for rural America
