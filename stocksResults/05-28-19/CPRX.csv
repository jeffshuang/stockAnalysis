keremoner,,2019-05-28 15:05:00,3.465,CPRX settles patent dispute and this is what we get Nothing will happen until a two bit privately held company makes its move I wish they would hurry upunless of course they are purposefully taking it slow for some strange reason
TesttheWaters,,2019-05-28 14:36:00,3.465,CPRX And what exactly are they supposed to say at this point Jacobus got approval but has no pricing no guarantee for reimbursement from payers probably no sales staff for it no nothing really Catalyst has no idea what the Jacobus impact will be other than the possible 11 pediatric patients until there actually is some type of impact Which could be months from now or possibly never A bad or nonsensical statement is going to be much worse than no statement
dkmadhvn,,2019-05-28 13:24:00,3.48,CPRX IMO Mgmnt will only speak after Jacobus launchnobody is going to believe a guidance before an important event
keremoner,,2019-05-28 13:01:00,3.525,CPRX we need to all email IR and tell them to pass the message to the executives that they should get off their butts How long does it take to formulate an answer Do they have conflicting opinions between their legal people and upper management as to how they should proceed Or are they waiting to hear from Jacobus as to pricing of their product before deciding
keremoner,,2019-05-28 12:58:00,3.525,CPRX interest in this has dried up but there are too many catalysts down the road to think this is done for As soon as we know what is going on with Jacobus this is either going back to 6 or down to 250s
arang,,2019-05-28 12:53:00,3.525,CPRX Maybe they are in more shole than we are expecting p
