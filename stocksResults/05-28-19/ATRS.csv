TDFOR32,True,2019-05-28 15:01:00,2.861,ATRS In my opinion the market is asleep insofar as the rapidly improving fundamentals of ATRS apparently choosing instead to focus on the plotting of its share price action on charts and trading the shares based on those out of touch charts rather than opening its eyes to ATRS rapidly growing revenues ie managements guidance of 95 to 105 million dollars of revenue for the full year 2019 and managements expectation of achieving break even revenues for ATRS fourth quarter 2019 results

TDFOR32,True,2019-05-28 11:55:00,2.9,ATRS If youve done your due diligence and concluded ATRS is a buy then all thats needed is patience in my opinion
TDFOR32,,2019-05-28 11:42:00,2.9,ATRS Looks like a good buying opportunity dip on light volume selling probably mostly by short sellers in my opinion
