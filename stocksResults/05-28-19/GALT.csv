D_Coral,True,2019-05-28 15:59:00,4.117,GALT The premarket and aftermarket hours will always be exciting going forward The stage is set for any big announcement now with the financing out of the way Must be scary for shorts
ScientificInvestments,,2019-05-28 15:51:00,4.094,GALT like clockwork Againthe execution is poor Second round is a high probability here but Lets hope galt gets a partner for Nash P3Wheres that protocol
btdiver,True,2019-05-28 15:48:00,4.099,GALT knucklehead is looking for guarantees and likes to invest after all data has been well confirmedof course the fact that markets anticipate and price in known information with great efficiency isnt important to knuckledraggers approach to investinghe feels its best to buy after the all clear has been soundedits smart just smart Dont speculate just wait until everything is assured and then buy cheap I dont know why I never considered this strategy Ill wait until an offer to buy GALT is on the table at say 20 and then Ill buy shares at 4 That way no speculationThanks knuckleshuffler
D_Coral,True,2019-05-28 15:37:00,4.09,GALT Its not a matter of IF this stock will jump multiples of the current price its a matter of WHEN It will happen when you least expect it Those who have patience will be rewarded You cant time these things instead you know the fundamentals of the science and clinical results and now the financing is lined up too
Scarliver,,2019-05-28 15:37:00,4.09,GALT Knucklehead people come to these boards for information There is nothing wrong with posting general scientific knowledge on NASH and immunooncology or on Galectin 3 for that matter Do you realize most accomplished doctors have never even heard of this protein Or Glycobiology I dont think CEOs of BP are going to be influenced by what is posted here However these boards allow retail to have a level playing field with institutional investors I also believe that there are people on this board who know more than any analyst following this stock Be happy we can all share and learn from each otherunless you are short
KnuckleSandwich,,2019-05-28 15:08:00,4.06,GALT Do posters here think that players in the Nash sector dont know about GALT science Will posting science details on this board result in a scientific epiphany for some biotech exec team that will spend 5B on GALT At this point GALT needs to deliver published data and it will speak for itself Everything else here is hot air and total speculation
Scarliver,,2019-05-28 14:53:00,4.075,GALT Data just presented at Digestive Diseases Week DDW Liver Disease NAFLD and NASH in particular three times more common in Crohns patients as compared to the rest of the population

D_Coral,True,2019-05-28 12:29:00,4.2,GALT Chiles Research Institute continues to Like posts on Twitter LinkedIn etc related to GALT It is a great show of confidence when the institute that helped win the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the clinical trials that led to cancer immunotherapy is the same team that is now hardcore supporters of GRMD02 oregonprovidenceorgnews
ChoppedLiver1,,2019-05-28 12:20:00,4.23,GALT So after months of partnership andor buyout from the fanboys followed by weeks of talk of the RO being oversubscribed by the same fanboys the FACTS are that the RO was drastically UNDER subscribed and had Richard Uihlein not committed to the 20M it would look even worse I give the COB lots of credit for his commitment to GALT had he not exercised those 5 warrants today the share price might be in the mid3s GALT now has 45M that will get the Ph3 started and probably fund it through 2020mid2021 with no funds for any other development This is a one drug one trial company at this point in time unless some kind of lightning in a bottle strikes regarding the Cancer studies to move the share price up enough so they can do a real secondary offering at a reasonable share price If not more loss of valueBy the way fanboys I exercised my RO rights obviously most shareholders took a pass and dilution that none of you recognized has arrived
KnuckleSandwich,,2019-05-28 12:18:00,4.229,GALT DU warrant exercise over RO price sets up a long term gain on his holdings when GALT is ultimately sold towards end cycle of Ph3 data

Cincy_JFM,True,2019-05-28 12:12:00,4.23,GALT DU just added 200 of his share count of his own MONEY here He now sits with between 758mm shares of a microcap biotech company Feels good knowing that my money is safe place along side of DU fundsAs others have stated here he was willing to exercise warrants at 5 that he could have sat on for another few years to show the market that our current pricing makes no senseI am very comfortable in our position Worse case is we get the trial up and running and need to raise another 2030mm down the line to finalize the trial At that point our IO portfolio will be in an entirely different position and we will have completed enrollment on a P3 trial Regardless of short term news this company should begin trading alongside the MC of our P3 NASH peers which is up from here Good Luck Bulls In DU and Belapectin we trustShow More
uborcoli,,2019-05-28 12:09:00,4.24,GALT exciting times ahead this is enough money to make things happen that will put out big press releases just like the other NASH Phase 3 companies that are trading for around 100share
StopaGE,,2019-05-28 12:08:00,4.24,GALT Shocking The RO was heavily under subscribed Up to 14M shares available but only sold 104 even with Big Dick oversubscribing Cant understand why he would exercise 500 warrants when he can buy the stock right now for 100 less
S2b,,2019-05-28 11:57:00,4.19,GALT PSA Be wary of the Pumptarded Clowns working for the shorts here
btdiver,True,2019-05-28 11:49:00,4.187,GALT warningShorts are running around here and feeling desperate nowhere to run to nowhere to hide so theyre starting to make up crap using terms they dont even understand themselves Be aware and be prepared to ignore
S2b,,2019-05-28 11:35:00,4.182,GALT While there is a decent amount of OI in the options the lack of volume is a bit disconcerting
neverending,True,2019-05-28 11:29:00,4.19,GALT Last time I checked when the COB buys 500000 shares 100 above the mkt its a good idea to do what he is doing Obviously sending a message as he could have bought that in the RO or in the secondary market I am buying shares today
Scarliver,,2019-05-28 11:19:00,4.104,GALT No short thesis left Company funded science solid
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-05-28 11:01:00,4.07,GALT Pretttttttttttttty sure DU bought 500k 5 to make a point He couldve got in at 428 PLUS the warrants The man makes statements with his actions He is not in the business of telling tall tales like some of the twisted shorts and fake longs on here I respect a billionaire business man he stands by what he believes also very unlikely he is wrong in his belief here FOLLOW THE MONEY PEOPLE Has investing taught you nothing
neverending,True,2019-05-28 10:46:00,4.025,GALT the company at this exact moment is in its BEST position EVER 60mm in the bank plenty to get through the next couple of years About to infuse first Ph3 patients in the fall and the COB just bought stock 1 above market Hello people
btdiver,True,2019-05-28 10:39:00,4.01,GALT Holy shit were green What a comeback story eh Rudy RÃ¼diger are you happy nowOf course if it trades down again youll be crying yourself to sleep tonight Sad that your entire psyche is determined by a 10 pivot I thought Rudy was supposed to have some balls I guess the real truth of the story is Rudy was actually too small to ever do anything on the team that had any real contribution Yep sounds like you Rudy
ChartMill,,2019-05-28 10:33:00,4.002,The technical rating of GALT is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment chartmillcomanalyzephpu
solafide,,2019-05-28 10:32:00,3.993,GALT Given that we were at 497 when the RO was announced and that 30 dilution would take us to 348 Im glad we are not there There will still be resistance at 428 for awhile or until Really Big News
qwertylicious2003,,2019-05-28 10:28:00,3.99,GALT can anyone intellectually explain why DU would exercise warrants above current share price
D_Coral,True,2019-05-28 10:20:00,3.969,GALT Im adding at this price Wired funds this morning Look at this without emotion just the facts Here you have a Phase 3 NASH company with the funds to get Phase 3 going for a few years where the typical market cap is at least 10x the GALT market cap and GALT has the superior drug Not to mention the possibility of partnering for cancer immunotherapy etc Easy decision to add at this price
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-05-28 10:19:00,3.969,GALT Close to 45 million raised My question is whether or not that includes the 20mm from DU His 20mm would only be at play if undersubscribed so it is now at play Either way this also leaves open the possibility this goes private This was EXACTLY the situation that could be the catalyst for a private takeover Lot of possibilities at play Still not worried as the SCIENCE HAS NOT CHANGED DU can EASILY raise 12 billion by snapping his fingers Thanos style Stay tuned still more unfolding to be done before people start crying wolf as per usual DD

D_Coral,True,2019-05-28 10:13:00,3.961,GALT The bottom line is that the company now has the to start Phase 3 to expand marketing efforts and to expand the management team Now no one can say that the company may run out of money This takes away an important attack line from the shorts Now combined with the solid science and clinical results and new funding we will start to see the press releases weve been waiting for
str8bite,,2019-05-28 10:12:00,3.961,GALT So with no interim data for nash P3 no chance for huge value increase on interim data release We have 44 of 70100mm needed to complete nash P3 Either we get a buyoutpartner or another raisedilution inevitable Was THAT really the plan DU
unoqualunqueroma,,2019-05-28 10:11:00,3.96,GALT dont like the situation hereit was supposed to be a success
RUDYRUDY,,2019-05-28 09:57:00,3.96,GALT RO was very poorly played by DU Stock dropping into 3s making all that subscribed total suckers
Scooby_snack,,2019-05-28 09:50:00,3.967,GALT DU aint gunna keep picking up the tab for Galt shareholders we need new money coming in if we wanna move What else besides P3 gunna get new In this
