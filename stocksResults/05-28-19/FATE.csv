corelon510,,2019-05-28 14:33:00,20.134,FATE one of my friend told me to buy it when it was 4 lol the CEO of FATE is very clever alwaysnot his first big hit
ProfitTaker2020,,2019-05-28 11:36:00,20.272,FATE probably has been fending off offers for the last few years 45B BO
ProfitTaker2020,,2019-05-28 11:35:00,20.24,FATE the 55 ish BO is less than 18 months away imo
AviTalman,True,2019-05-28 11:17:00,20.22,APVO And as a comparison of how cheap the stock is APVO Fate Therapeutics FATE which a while ago had a similar balance sheet to Aptevos is in a similar space but is valued about 20X more than Aptevo without any commercial products Granted every company is different and expectations for FATEs pipeline are different from Aptevo but FATE does not have a product to market yet or a product that promises incremental revenue so as to reduce cash burn
nitehawk,True,2019-05-28 10:49:00,20.16,FATE next level is 30 bucks Should get bought out soon
dixiebull,,2019-05-28 10:25:00,19.901,FATE nice move from my alert I like this stock
JRMKE,,2019-05-28 09:58:00,19.447,FATE 200day SMA should hit 1500 tomorrow Been ascending for 18 months
