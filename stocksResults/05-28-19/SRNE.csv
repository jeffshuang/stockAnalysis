relay,,2019-05-28 12:56:00,3.29,SRNE my talent does not seem to lie in buying stocks that go up but buying stocks that go down and getting out before the steep decline out at 380 for a loss
KSleep,,2019-05-28 12:42:00,3.31,SRNE I am new here but I think it is a given that the stock is going down with the next few quarters Their revenue includes ZTildo and money earned for pharmaceutical manufacturing for other companies They will be spending a lot to conduct and validate their trials the next few quarters which leads me to believe that they cash flow and earnings will continue to fall I am in it for the long hall but the position is not without riskDoes anyone see any errors in my thought process I would love to hear what I am missing I am not a day trader but I think the shorts will continue to drive the price until either revenue serious increases or new FDA approvals are obtained
