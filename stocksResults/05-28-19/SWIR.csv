iotinvestor,True,2019-05-28 11:50:00,12.87,SWIR Interesting The Tank Monitoring link on SWIR page takes you to wesrocsolutionscomitankhtml which is becoming anovacomoneco They said they divested the iTank brand so why keep the link to it Maybe an agreement with new Co to continue to use SWIR for connectivity solutions But they have 1000s of such agreements why not a link to all them too I sometimes get the feeling SWIR is not being fully transparent with share holders
