cobbs,True,2019-05-28 11:41:00,54.229,SESN GH ARNA were my spots over the weekend and they executed perfectly All open bell orders all winners VTVT is my riskreward pick for data opened a small position I can afford to take losses on but the data outlook imo seems positive based off what Ive read and history of the company probably the most excited about this one and SESN its close Looking to sell SESN 1 or 2 days before meeting at the peak and hold a small position for long term
