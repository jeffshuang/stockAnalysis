TAFA,,2019-05-28 13:46:00,6.15,VHC ipstickuphisass has no idea what he is talking about folks CAFC already ruled VirnetXs patents are valid CAFC overrules PTAB not the other way around IBM and Japan integrating VirnetX into their ecosystems makes VirnetX a takeover target that pays for itself overnight 1 billion soon to be in the bank from apple CAFC not delaying or reversing themselves They are expediting ALL this apple bullshit into one final death blow for apple after apples slap in the face en bancrehearing request despite the chief judges warning to stop wasting the courts time
IPcurious,,2019-05-28 13:34:00,6.229,VHC folks just please remember and go back and read my posts I was one of the most ardent supporters of VHC I have been invested in this stock for YEARS I am not some basher that is not up to speed with this stock to the contrary I know this stock backwards and forwards However you cannot invest with emotion which is exactly what so many people do People need to be aware of the facts and the risks If the CAFC wanted to uphold the Rule 36 they would have done so weeks ago Something is clearly going on behind the scenesMoreover I have yet to hear from any bull why KL has to pay himself and his wife and whoever else from his family such a ridiculous salary for a company that makes NO MONEY He lives lavishly he sells stock at will yet its all crickets from the bulls What happened to the licensing agreement with PITA NOTHING Why would anyone want to pay to license when they can just steal it and have face no consequences Moreover the PTAB has invalidated the patents
TAFA,,2019-05-28 13:10:00,6.22,VHC 12 in 2 trading days you folks not heeding my calls must hate money apple certainly hates making money for their shareholders leaving vhc an independent entity other giants like IBM are not as stupid taking over a company that pays for itself overnight
IPcurious,,2019-05-28 12:55:00,6.246,VHC ASM was a bunch of nonsense Why didnt anyone there ask KL why he robs the shareholders for his personal benefit Everyone who goes to the ASM are a bunch of ass kissers Even with favorable CAFC ruling this has limited upside and will collapse as everyone will be rushing to sell Downside will be catastrophic if CAFC somehow rules for Apple There are way better investment on the stock market than this stock Beware
