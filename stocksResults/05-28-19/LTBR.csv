BusinessClass,,2019-05-28 13:00:00,0.8251,LTBR Im wondering what is effected by the DOE rejection If there is a utility contract it doesnt make sense for that to be significantly altered since it began prior to the DOE grant existing and there are already forces in motion to produce rods but then again I dont know what the hold up has been all this time However the Nuscale relationship could be delayed by the missed grant since it is still in early stages and the lack of money resources and credibility the grant wouldve provided may delay that It may create reason for pause at Nuscale while they digest the reasons for the 2nd rejection though the 1st rejection didnt stop them from pursuing an MOU In the post rejection world Id like to see an official communication from LTBR about the rejection and renewed signs of progress sent from Framatome themselves As much as I dont want to be swindled by the LTBR moving goal post game I dont believe it is game over YET

manunfurled,,2019-05-28 12:11:00,0.8151,LTBR looking at weaknesses1 applicant DOES NOT PROVIDE adequate detail Lets assume the Company really does have a utility contract in final stages of negotiation and really cant share details due to confidentiality Then once it is public those details CAN be provided in a subsequent DOE application 2 HALEU I had this same question on a previous call and failed to ask as some part of me presumed these folks know better than II imagine there will be an explanation that will address this soon enough

Arpeggio,,2019-05-28 09:52:00,0.8199,LTBR Utility demonstration with LRT of 5 would show that all is feasible and commitment Real improvements come with HALEU Stock is rangeboundlow volume without news IMO I did ask IR if there is anything prohibiting Framatome or EDF from buying LTBR stock
