kevinmik,,2019-05-28 09:48:00,1.125,MNKD Mikes commercial strategy for Afrezza is a joke In the US he continues to pursue an expensive failed solo strategy and his international strategy is all over the place going from needing regional deals to then needing one pharma partner then going back to regional deals all with small time players On June 27 2019 Afrezza Technospehre Inhaled Drug Delivery Platform will celebrate their 5th anniversary as commercially approved drug delivery device in the United States and today Afrezza weekly NRx cant break 300 consistently in the entire United States only one International Afrezza regulatory filing no international approvals or sales and Technosphere only has one new drug moving in the pipeline through UTHR Its time for a Mannkind shakeup company to once and for all maximize and unlock the huge pent up value Alfred Mann has created within Mannkind
