ICU812,True,2019-05-28 15:07:00,1.48,ADMP Look I can understand the anxiety that is prevalent as each day sees a sagging SP and people begin to doubt their investment Like most I am heavily underwater I do however have faith in Adamis management Carlo has been involved in biotech for over thirty years and worked side by side with people like Jonas Salk He is named on 23 patents and has authored over 225 articles and abstracts in the field of Immunology Info taken from company site You really dont think he knows what hes doing The company has a hell of a pipeline and a revolutionary delivery system in Symjepi already FDA approved btw and a huge player 2 market and sell it The deal wSandoz itself has gotten immense praise from critics Yes I too wish there was more positive news forthcoming 2 feed the insatiable beast that is the retail investor but there isnt and Im pretty sure at this point they would release some if they had some The news will come when it comes and que sera sera WKWWO

wjgesq,,2019-05-28 14:15:00,1.475,ADMP Hard to believe how far and hard we have fallen from 645 preapproval Staggeringly bad turn of events and the lack of a real retail release after two years is one for the record books

thecapster,,2019-05-28 13:03:00,1.49,ADMP upon Sandoz retail launch this could very well have an expansion gap upDoes the past really matter now of what could have been
beachsidefreddy,,2019-05-28 13:03:00,1.49,ADMP THERES A CHANGE IN THE AIR
Tdc1,,2019-05-28 12:54:00,1.498,ADMP what bowenhardcase just posted is so fing brutally true
BowenHardcase,,2019-05-28 12:43:00,1.5,ADMP This shouldve been sitting at 1150 waiting for launch not 15 and that shouldve been in Dec17 not staring down the barrel of June 19Opportunity costs for ADMP and SH literally in hundreds of millions by now With very little effort and an iota of common sense from Carlo this could easily have been a 20 dollar stock right now
brawler,,2019-05-28 12:39:00,1.495,ADMP Carlo needs to be outhe did not invent or launch polio vache has no credibility n shud stop preaching the 3 phase of truththe reality go retireif he had 3 years go he wud have been in a better position n so would we
beachsidefreddy,,2019-05-28 12:23:00,1.5,ADMP WE HAVE OURSELVES A 10000 BID HERE FOLKS
beachsidefreddy,,2019-05-28 12:18:00,1.5,ADMP SHORTS ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT LAUNCH DATE OH THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING
Charlie_Buffett,,2019-05-28 12:15:00,1.493,ADMP Not a technician but bouncing around 150 in a 10 range for one week looks like a bottom to me With launch around the corner next earning with real sales and followed by Nalox Looks good to me in the next months
ElDonJuan,True,2019-05-28 11:46:00,1.48,ADMP SYMJEPI RETAIL AND JR LAUNCH INCOMING
djs344,,2019-05-28 11:37:00,1.47,ADMP man this is below 150 Carlo sure knows how to run a stock into the ground
_CybrWzrd7,,2019-05-28 11:32:00,1.49,ADMP Retail launch coming soon Time your entry
PhosLow,,2019-05-28 11:26:00,1.48,ADMP Covered some at 1483Will cover rest next Monday before retail launch of Symjepi on Tuesday
DetroitRobbie,,2019-05-28 11:17:00,1.48,ADMP this stock makes me hate my life
BowenHardcase,,2019-05-28 10:53:00,1.494,ADMP longs are praying for launch but Im concerned that the news wont do much Hopefully Im wrong but I dont see launch news alone being enough to reverse this downward spiral There are lots of borrowed shares out there looking to squash any run and 99 of SH are looking to get out asap even if it it means just getting less red it might kick up to 17s area or maybe even sniff 2 again but will likely run out of steam and bleed to sub 1 soon enough Maybe if launch is soon and they can report amazing numbers for Q3 come Dec then maybe can get something rolling for 2020 But for now 2019 is dead and longs can officially blame Sandoz
beachsidefreddy,,2019-05-28 10:49:00,1.495,ADMP THAT SHORT ATTACK SHOWED ME NOTHING
Icedoggy,,2019-05-28 10:48:00,1.493,ADMP I hate admp My wife is going to divorce me when I can no longer provide top ramen for breakfast lunch and dinner

MissCleoKnows,,2019-05-28 10:36:00,1.475,ADMP buttfux strikes again with moronic comment Sandals I had said thats not true so I dont know why it keeps getting brought up
ElDonJuan,,2019-05-28 10:36:00,1.475,ADMP makes no sense
BudFox1,,2019-05-28 10:35:00,1.475,ADMP Seems like Sandoz wont launch retail until patent dispute resolved Why else such an unreasonable delay

KeepRollin,,2019-05-28 10:24:00,1.5,ADMP I guess the buyout didnt happen over the weekend All pumpers have an eye on the June 1st Friday 750 pm However when that doesnt happen the statement quickly will shift toat the beginning of next quarter
beachsidefreddy,,2019-05-28 09:32:00,1.54,ADMP IF ADMAP HAD ITS PATENT DISPUTE CERTIFIED BY OUTSIDE SOURCE AND THEIR FINDINGS WERE SO SOLID THAT ADMP FELT QUALIFIED TO DISMISS THEM IN FILING WITH FDA WE ARE GOOD
GNinja2006,,2019-05-28 09:30:00,1.512,ADMP Now I have to decide where to reenter
