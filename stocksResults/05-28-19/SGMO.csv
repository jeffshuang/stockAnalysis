Dladla,True,2019-05-28 15:56:00,9.683,SGMO Guys its time to celebrate Were the last ones left in the race for a proper HemA gene therapy and our data looks superior The market will take its time as it always does for biotechs
Dladla,True,2019-05-28 15:49:00,9.637,SGMO our slowass approach on everything will prove to be the right one in the long run ONCE and BMRN both rushed and got burned doing so SGMO is the wise turtle that will win the race current data clearly looks superior
siteobserver,True,2019-05-28 13:17:00,9.802,SESN VSTM OMER SGMO IBB Because of the holiday this week Tues is like a typical Monday which is normally down for biotechs If true tomorrow should see a biotech bounce
Rodman77,,2019-05-28 12:35:00,9.756,SGMO BMRN effectiveness in the phase III trial has continued to wane and early data from a phase III trial seem to suggest an even weaker response seem to confirm concerns about products durability and ability to compete with rival gene therapies SGMO PFE Three Year data from hemophilia A therapy fail to squash concerns of durability but the company insist they are good enough to file who else think they are on Shaky Grounds
DomLuminous,False,2019-05-28 12:30:00,9.786,SGMO did BMRN just put this out 3 years out after 1 dose and blood levels stable for biomarin insane
Rodman77,,2019-05-28 12:18:00,9.765,If I were SGMO at this point I would be scouring through BMRN Data to Exploit it to their Advantage
Ovid,,2019-05-28 12:13:00,9.763,SGMO This really is junk All of the BS on the IV board all the wasted time This company is for suckers Just waiting on the class action at this point Amazing no insider buys when this pig is trading 2 below the secondary from last month WoW really if this was any other facet of business these jokers would be shown the door The BOD is not just out to lunch they are out to dinner as well The CMO and CFO both resigned in the past 2 months I would have liked it better had they both been let go but Sandy the Moron actually said he was sorry to see Yi go which means she left on her own This is a major lawsuit waiting to happen When the rats leave the ship should investors just asking for a friend

Dougeefresh,False,2019-05-28 11:12:00,9.74,SGMO nobody has figured out the durability issue SGMO isnt special MPS data was nonsensical Hemo data is sensible but factor VII levels will fall just like BMRN Tregs arent the answer ZFN 20 wont help durability only specificity and efficiency
