siteobserver,,2019-05-28 14:10:00,1.24,VSTM Today I added shares at 122 I am pragmatic and cautious but I also believe VSTMs management team is competent and revenue growth will kick in during the THIRD quarter Ive been buying 2020 2021 calls and most recently VSTM stock based on this belief that the second half is when real results begin I prefer investing at the bottom buying deep lows when I think there is potential for a rebound
CirrusTrading,True,2019-05-28 14:03:00,1.215,VSTM tacto Ive read many mbs where there were knowledgeable ppl about the stock but you are by far the most dedicated and astute investor Ive ever seen Ups and downs never shaken You should be sitting in person at every BOD meeting just out of sheer principle Keep up the good work

Tacto,True,2019-05-28 13:20:00,1.215,VSTM If biggies were selling theyd run the price up to do so They are buying which is why theyre layering the Ask at top of book and spoofing like the fake 75k they continue to show at 130 They sell into strength and buy into weakness even if they are the ones who create the strength or weakness or perception of it

siteobserver,,2019-05-28 12:39:00,1.23,VSTM Driving down the stock price is premature until we see scrips 2 or 3 weeks from now because June scrips will tell us if Copiktra is being refilled growing revenues or not

siteobserver,,2019-05-28 11:39:00,1.24,VSTM SCRIP TRACKING IS CRITICALOkay follow me on this if the 16 scrips reported 2 weeks ago reflected refills from scrips that were new a month before that then approx one month from the 16 scrip week we should see a week with those 16 scrips refilled again plus any new scrips Logically the 5th week from the 16 scrip week we should see 20 or more scrips If so were on track for steady growth If NOT then the refills are not repeating or accumulating Its not rocket science Either scrips and refills are growing and accumulatingor not Patients stay on Copiktra 2 years or more but some stop due to adverse effects If they are staying on the drugs refills will repeat and INCREASE every 4 or 5 weeks and this should show up in scrip reports
