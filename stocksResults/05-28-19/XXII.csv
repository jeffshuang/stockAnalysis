Congostockchat,True,2019-05-28 15:26:00,2.168,XXII I was 12 when I started smoking 3 DECADES of smoking trying numerous times to quit without success How interested would I have been as a smoker in a NON ADDICTIVE VLN cig That lets you cut back with little to no side effects Folks we are not taking about 1 of smokers We are talking about more than half in my view More than half of a 700 Billion dollar worldwide industry FOLKS its freaking CRAZY how big this can be in terms of the stock and company and in terms of lives saved This is the biggest damn thing EVER for public health EVER This is the biggest CANCER stockever EVER EVER

RevBAFrederick,,2019-05-28 15:18:00,2.144,XXII There have been so many opportunities for mgmt to stabilize the stock price at a much higher valuation than right now Again the amount they took advantage of at XXII headquarters is still zeroIm just saying theres little anyone can say anymore that supports a positive spin on past and presumably future efforts
RevBAFrederick,,2019-05-28 15:10:00,2.141,XXII Almost every country in the world is going VLN Wow I must have missed maybe 1000 articles or so explaining thatTell us Nickalus exactly how many countries has XXII sold to so far out of all the countries in the worldMy count is zero but by all means correct me if Im wrong
Nickalus,True,2019-05-28 14:21:00,2.115,XXII Everyone is stuck on it just being the US to make money with VLN almost every country is joining the party and talking about VLN so many opportunities
dirkstockdiggler,,2019-05-28 14:19:00,2.115,XXII 25k tied up holding bags for entirely too long Congo I hope you are right 3 would work nicely
StonedHedge2,,2019-05-28 14:06:00,2.115,XXII thats a question thats been unanswered for over 2 years and when you do ask for particulars Henry tells us hes doing a fabulous job and if you dont like it you should sell your shares

Congostockchat,True,2019-05-28 10:44:00,2.112,XXII and so with all this going on why in the world is this stock still at 212 a share I dont know folks but something tells me that the is going to soon be roadkill
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-28 10:42:00,2.12,XXII this company in their conference calls laid out some astounding numbers that could be achieved if this product can even achieve a 1 market share If the FDA is going to make all tobacco vln by my count the market share will not be 1 it will be 100 And that is not all I have spoken as part of my due diligence too many smokers I smoke myself for three decades I was hopelessly addicted to smoking No one wants to be addicted to smoking American Spirit sold just international for 5 billion dollars That is one brand That would be something along the lines of 40 to 50 per share for this stock We would have VLN for all brands Those who suggest that this could be a 100 200 400 per share stock are not incorrect Big tobacco is going to be little tobacco And XXII is going to be big tobacco
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-28 10:37:00,2.11,XXII the FDA issued a statement That statement says that all tobacco will be VLN That is not what this company said in their initial application The FDA sent that application back to XXII and then released that news There is no other product besides this one that can comply with that Other companies are free to try But they will fail Big tobacco themselves said it will take them 20plus years to even begin to do it Without approving this product there is no new tobacco regulations Our product is the tobacco regulation Prepare for approval
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-28 10:33:00,2.11,XXII just imagine for a minute you are sitting at the FDA with the power to approve this 6 million people a year die from this about 60 million people over the last decade alone They have a product here before them that makes smoking not addictive A product that allows people to dramatically cut back smoking with little to no withdrawal even That is what study after study shows including the governments own massive phase 3 test Those individuals have the power to do the biggest thing ever for public health that has ever been done Prepare for approval
Nickalus,,2019-05-28 09:57:00,2.122,XXII Hopefully everyone had a great 3 day weekend now lets see the markets settle so this can go back up
