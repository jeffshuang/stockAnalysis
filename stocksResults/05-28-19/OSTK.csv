JustHereToMakeSomeMoney,,2019-05-28 15:40:00,10.191,OSTK retail should have been sold by now and the full focus should be on mv The amount of time effort and cash it will take to turn a 20 mill retail profit isnt worth it If they were offered 500 mill for retail theyre foolish for not taking it Holding out for a higher valuation isnt worth it Tzero will be pumping out cash in a few years SELL RETAIL Scary Byrne is making that decision

thebearishbull,,2019-05-28 15:33:00,10.2,Only byrne and OSTK could invest 150 million in blockchain and have it go as badly as it did Imagine if he actually had invested that money in something worthwhile Ostk would be 50 now not heading to 5

HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-28 15:10:00,10.247,OSTK this dose not go to single digits again but with no volume and shorts playing games you wait
Lynchmob52,,2019-05-28 15:07:00,10.271,OSTK wants single digits again

StockFrank,,2019-05-28 15:03:00,10.3,OSTK the company and the CEO cannot just leave a broken stock like this its a shame
Lynchmob52,,2019-05-28 14:59:00,10.349,OSTK looks like everyone has thrown in the towel
eyesontsx,,2019-05-28 14:43:00,10.382,OSTK Cohodes has changed his Twitter picture Its no longer the one of him and Overstock Byrne having a beer
maxi8,False,2019-05-28 14:11:00,10.44,OSTK This stock is literally at recession pricing
maxi8,False,2019-05-28 14:10:00,10.43,OSTK Worst investment ever Same person with different accounts trying to justify this abomination of a stock
JustHereToMakeSomeMoney,,2019-05-28 13:41:00,10.458,OSTK PB fought real hard against the correlation to bitcoin Hindsight that could prove to be a big mistake
pk8123,,2019-05-28 13:31:00,10.376,OSTK maybe it already is FIRIN TIME
pk8123,,2019-05-28 13:09:00,10.469,OSTK if they were not already breaking this thing up with corporate actions I would expect a corporate activist to step in and it would be FIRIN TIME for Byrne
_bhaveshpatel,,2019-05-28 13:09:00,10.469,OSTK This POS cannot get up and fight Keep going down everyday
pk8123,,2019-05-28 13:08:00,10.469,OSTK basically here you get everything for free online business can be sold and stock gap runs much higher easily hits 20 handle on Tzero alone
skellymak,True,2019-05-28 12:54:00,10.538,OSTK 101 bid to sell gotta love that
JustHereToMakeSomeMoney,,2019-05-28 12:43:00,10.505,OSTK Is there a launch date for crypto trading
MJG1973,,2019-05-28 12:40:00,10.51,OSTK I think most organizations would have launched crypto trading by this point but OSTK has always been keenly aware of how important security is As Brian Kelly CNBC says They are doing it right Still I think were trading cryptos this week
JustHereToMakeSomeMoney,,2019-05-28 12:18:00,10.501,OSTK catalyst catalyst catalystwhere r u Everyone is waiting Some more patiently than others Weve hit rock bottom Market hedging against ostk mgmt Not going to pay for potential Mgmt backed into a corner Execution is the only thing moving this stock Question is when
pk8123,,2019-05-28 12:14:00,10.462,OSTK it is not a conflict of interest for CEO to reinvest in an illiquid piece of the company I totally disagree Shows conviction at least someone here has it Stock is too cheap on breakup value 20 handle on Tzero alone
Lynchmob52,,2019-05-28 12:07:00,10.447,OSTK obvious tobacco believes this is worth way north of 18 Must have some confidence in sum of parts PB obviously was margined called Not a fan of narrative to reinvest directly in subsidiaries of Medici as it is a conflict of interest with all OSTK shareholders
themoneytrail,,2019-05-28 11:47:00,10.482,OSTK Its looking weak again today The past four days has been to Spike on the open then immediately fade

maxi8,False,2019-05-28 11:03:00,10.479,OSTK why does this stock keep dumping on a daily basis
MJG1973,,2019-05-28 11:01:00,10.477,OSTK First other companies are throwing money at the concept Second thats just one piece of the blockchain play STOs are the most promising in the near term They have an STO deal with the builder of the Burj Khalifa Think it takes any capital to build something like that
loveAll,False,2019-05-28 10:47:00,10.569,OSTK look if t0 tech was so bleeding edge and promising larger companies with deep pockets would be begging to throw their money at it
MJG1973,,2019-05-28 10:37:00,10.573,OSTK 60 of float shorted means this thing is like a very tightly coiled spring Either shorts keep ratcheting the pressure down or there will be a massive uncoiling event Once it unwinds itll be rapid and massive Theres a lot higher chance of an explosion than much more downward pressure
tradingview2018,True,2019-05-28 10:36:00,10.582,OSTK ready to go back 11 and up

pk8123,,2019-05-28 10:07:00,10.674,OSTK come to think of it I dont know why Zuckerberg at FB would not just buy this tzero deal or invest to get time to market
themoneytrail,True,2019-05-28 10:04:00,10.654,OSTK Really light volume today so MMs have plenty of power for price manipulation
pk8123,,2019-05-28 10:04:00,10.654,OSTK all they have to do is say trading live and trading globalcoin and stock is up 100 that days
HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-28 10:03:00,10.605,OSTK Oky shorts you want to play games HELMETS ON

pk8123,,2019-05-28 09:45:00,10.897,OSTK this is an easy double under any scenario unless China or N Korea nukes something and world ends 20 handle quickly on Tzero launch Facebook launch of Globalcoin in 2020 will see OSTK much much higher
MJG1973,,2019-05-28 09:45:00,10.897,OSTK Shorts are trying to cover Dont sell them your share cheap Hold out
HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-28 09:44:00,10.931,OSTK I would hate to have a large short position now on this stock No volume and big bounce off the bottom how do you cover without a major short SQUEEZE
pk8123,,2019-05-28 09:42:00,10.993,OSTK rereading the Q report this company is mispriced once the P goes to a token and Tzero launches this easily doubles Hatred of CEO is OK at 50100 not here
