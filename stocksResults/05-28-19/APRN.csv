StormTiger,,2019-05-28 13:04:00,0.7258,APRN some thoughts on the depressed share price and the coming RSBAs balance sheet shows us that its cash position is basically funded by its fully drawn revolving credit facility Now theyll burn through that cash if they cant get a bump from an extended credit facility UnlikelySo instead theyll do two things 1 Go for a secondary offering through dilutive action using a reverse split 2 Try to conserve their cash by cost containment and focus on marginpositive product salesWe know the reverse split is coming In the absence of a compelling growth story and the delisting notice they will effect a reverse split soon and when they do they will write issue new shares from their authorized allotment The new share issuance will put NEW paidin capital to company balance sheet at the revised postRS price This has a dilutive effect on common shares and share price will drop Remember if share price were to rise the VCs would have made more holding not sellingShow More
