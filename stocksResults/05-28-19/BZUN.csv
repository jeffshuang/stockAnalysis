AquaKnight,,2019-05-28 14:24:00,38.27,BZUN this is likely where it peaks today 3830 its hitting the bottom of the cloud and wont cross it unless ER is a home run it actually tried to cross it on the 21st and 22nd but was denied twice then unrelated but RSI and STO are in our favor right now oversold still hedge if you need to with puts theres no support down here so I dont know where we go on a bad ER result a good ER result will knock us back over the MAs and ideally over cloud support to continue the bullish uptrend weve been experiencing since the start of 2019good luck everyone
