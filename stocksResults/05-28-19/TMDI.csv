Deviner,,2019-05-28 09:43:00,2.786,TMDI Going down Told you so No good can come from management trying to line their own pockets with the lousy work they have done without spending a dime of their own money Tomorrow they are going to reduce the strike price of the past options so that they can wipe out the past price when TMD was at a higher price and they can profit from present low price Can you trust this kind of management
