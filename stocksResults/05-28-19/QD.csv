jdollartsun,,2019-05-28 11:01:00,7.118,QD The only thing that bothers me about this stock is that there is not really a good solid base for this to take off from The weekly price ranges are wide and sporadic I like my stock charts more tight organized and predictable Great bullish stocks are usually tight and organized across the board monthly weekly and daily charts

chereches,True,2019-05-28 09:32:00,7.423,QD Strategic cooperation with Minsheng Bank is yet another move from the management to increase shareholder value It is not a founding partnership its much more important QD is providing high deep value tech which means that the already minuscule multiple is going thru the roof They are moving from a risky financial sector business with its own valuation metrics towards software valuation In addition to providing software for big banks they are already building a simple plug and play financial service for other apps in order to help them monetize Higher valuation less risk profits Where else can we find this
