WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-05-28 10:48:00,7.768,ENPH SPWR Curioius how many Enphase longs are SPWR longs and vice versa I have both but a much smaller position in SPWR Great products but not convinced that their business model has enough margin to be consistently profitable They are releasing their own battery product later this year and trying to transition to services Promising but very speculative given their difficulty in generating profits and their high CapEx costs Really hope they can turn it around as a strong SPWR is great for ENPH For those that follow SPWR closely what do you think will be the catalyst that can really turn things around
