Zippy5I0,,2019-05-28 13:52:00,1.425,PTN for people new to trading or new to stock twits I believe this will help you sift through some of the bullshitThe definition of dilutionDilution occurs when a company issues new stock which results in a decrease of an existing stockholders ownership percentage of that company Dilution can also occur when holders of stock options such as company employees or holders of other optionable securities exercise their options When the number of shares outstanding increases each existing stockholder owns a smaller or diluted percentage of the company making each share less valuable All of PTN stock optionswarrants have been exercised and as seen is the transcript below PTN has 198million on hand and is funded through the second quarter of 2020 There is absolutely No Dilution going on in this company and anyone saying otherwise is simply trying to manipulate this stock to cover a short position or create a better entry point for themselves GLTAShow More
