Pineapple1,True,2019-06-04 10:46:00,2.88,AVXL Reviewing the 148 week presentation I noticed something I had not thought about one of the slides mentions that there have been no AEs or SAEs in the remaining 21 patients Think about that once they stabilize the patient on dose no adverse events no serious adverse events and the patients continue to take the drug beyond the original length of trial so far 2 and a half years longer Hmm something must be going right at the very least it does no harm which is better than all of the current treatments for disease Maybe one day one of the news organizations will do a story on Anavexs success and update the Super Responders status Anavex Now
