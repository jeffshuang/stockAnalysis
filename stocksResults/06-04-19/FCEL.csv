audi65,True,2019-06-04 10:31:00,1.151,FCEL Its definitely not a good sign when the pps is still floundering in the 110 right before your next ER which supposedly was going to be a good one I do hope Im wrong because I have a lot of riding on this stock but cant feel happy at all seeing such strong selling still going on at this point I seriously thought wed be trading around 150 by now Well just have to wait see what numbers come back on their next ER coming up in a few days JMHO GLTA
