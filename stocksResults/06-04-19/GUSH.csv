ralphyg57,,2019-06-04 10:45:00,6.462,GUSH The deal is that because the US oil industry is so large now and we import so little oil relative to 15 years ago higher oil prices are actually a net positive for US GDP China opposite story they basically got jack squat oil reserves so they are busting ass developing electric cars to reduce dependency on imported oil So consumer pays a little more at the pump by producing the bulk of the oil we consume it keeps the money right here circulating in the US We are not subsidizing middle east or the Ruskies Good for Powell to come out and pump the markets
