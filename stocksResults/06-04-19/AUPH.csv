williamd8,True,2019-06-04 15:37:00,6.58,AUPH like many others here I just dont understand ILJINs position especially the timing Seems fishy Do I think the SP should be higher given results so far Absolutely but Ill take the lower SP now to load up more for 45 a year from now
Labelguy1122,True,2019-06-04 15:37:00,6.58,AUPH lets see if this causes manage management to release some positive news to pick up the price

johntall,True,2019-06-04 14:34:00,6.52,AUPH Thanks to all who have struggled with this decision I know that we are operating with a fraction of the information needed but collectively we gave it the old college try And those that read and help were left in a position to cast semiinformed votesKudos to us
Iceman467,True,2019-06-04 14:28:00,6.524,AUPH Im voting for change It wont be controlling but it could compel this to move closer to where its true value is
SteveTexans,True,2019-06-04 14:27:00,6.524,AUPH I would expect or hope Duggan andor other large tutes holders would publicly state their opinion andor sides in the matter This would add clarity to this ordeal WE NEED A NONBIAS THIRD PARTY MEMBER WITH ACCESS TO INSIDE INFORMATION

PerroMalo,,2019-06-04 13:38:00,6.496,AUPH It looks like well just have to trust the brokerage firms and other tutes to do the right thing by us retailers as far as the election is concerned Typically Id be a little uncomfortable with that but I think in this instance we are on the same page

jarepeo,True,2019-06-04 12:57:00,6.52,AUPH The only decision that BOD may have overlooked was the move forward with DES It is apparent to me that this hesitation is to allow offers to come in for its purchase If such is the case then it was a prudent decision not to invest time and resources to go forward on their own Greenleaf did give a time limit on thisEvery decision has been made to support going forward I dont buy what Iljin is saying or doing Yellow4Me
Labelguy1122,True,2019-06-04 12:54:00,6.52,AUPH love this propaganda pic lol Not voting for ILJIN

PolarBear1,True,2019-06-04 11:49:00,6.575,AUPH Perfect Found this in the 2014 AIF on SEDAR How is this not a conflict of interest is Dr Foster really an independent nominee Under the terms of an agreement dated February 14 2014 whereby Dr Robert Fosters employment as CSO was terminated by the Company it was confirmed that effective March 8 2012 pursuant to a resolution of the Board Dr Foster was entitled to receive 2 of royalty licensing revenue for royalties received on the sale of voclosporin by licensees andor 03 of net sales of voclosporin sold directly by the Company to be paid quarterly as that revenue is received by the Company Should the Company sell substantially all of the assets of voclosporin to a third party or transfer those assets to another party in a merger in a manner such that this payment obligation is no longer operative then Dr Foster will be entitled to receive 03 of the value attributable to voclosporin in the transaction VOTE YELLOW PROXIES TODAY Support our Board
paperjam,,2019-06-04 11:48:00,6.57,AUPH Btw another oddity is this bit and to move market perception away from a binary bet on the success of voclosporin in treating LN I guess they never heard of DES FSGS
johntall,True,2019-06-04 11:42:00,6.565,AUPH Market is up 400 and we are flatOh well we will get past this drama and our day will be great

IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-06-04 11:31:00,6.56,AUPH Holding strong Aurinia Keep up the good work Yellow ALL the way Aurinia will have a response very soon to clarify some of the claims that IlJin has made Lots of their claims are inaccurate and spun to meet their agenda
UT_RPh,True,2019-06-04 11:30:00,6.56,AUPH all would need to do for transplant indication on label would be a phase 4 study which is often done anyway Prevalent practice patterns IMO will be use of VOC in transplants Below is exert from a Phase 4 explanation
johntall,True,2019-06-04 11:24:00,6.524,AUPH While I do appreciate mmmHmmms summary I am not sure that IR has added much light to the situationWhat are the current BODs plans for the drugs in trials as well as the company itself And be specific With real numbersI do realize that most boards do not have to be so candid with shareholders but most boards do not need our help to keep from getting thrown out
ElephantSeal,,2019-06-04 11:14:00,6.49,AUPH Uncertainty creates volatility Concrete statements regarding shareholder plans will help investors make clear decisions
Cash_Tree,,2019-06-04 11:14:00,6.49,AUPH did I hear iljin will exit its position if its proxy is unsuccessful Jw
UT_RPh,True,2019-06-04 11:12:00,6.509,AUPH average price per month for cyclosporin generic It is needed for years in transplants Not a short term treatment 67000 pharmacies in the US If only one patient per pharmacy would be over 80 million a year in sales Of course VOC would be under brand name and superior to cyclosporin so at least cost twice as much If safety profile holds out would be added to pipeline
HarryPopotter,,2019-06-04 11:09:00,6.52,AUPH If voclosporin is the holy grail that is impossible that Aurinia stays so much time on this level 67s The Korean are right That is not consistent
HowdoIGRAPH,True,2019-06-04 11:07:00,6.53,AUPH I will most likely be voting yellow Prepare for the short attack

Neil_Armstrong,,2019-06-04 10:45:00,6.44,AUPH following up on mmhmmm I have been invited to meet with them as well Are there any follow up questions any one wants me to ask
UT_RPh,True,2019-06-04 10:44:00,6.442,AUPH Ive said it before but mark my word I feel after P3 VOC will become major drug in transplants Years ago we dispensed a lot of cyclosporine for same Of course the side effects greatly diminished its use but is still used We have one patient on cyclosporine now
Secret_Stocks,,2019-06-04 10:42:00,6.46,AUPH why are we down on a good day
mmmhmmm,,2019-06-04 10:32:00,6.508,AUPH I just finished my skype meeting with Auriniathings that stood out in our conversation1 AUPHs view is the 3 Iljin nominees do not have the necessary qualifications and experience needed to navigate regulatory and approval process 2 AUPH will not be seeking to add any additional drug candidates for development until there is some clarity on Voclosporin I interpret that to mean until after Phase 3 results Interestingly he did not rule out the possibility giving the spill about always being on the look out for ways to increase shareholder value3 No decision yet made on keeping dry eye in house or selling off4 Options are awarded to directors to try to incentivize them to work in the interest of shareholders so that part of Iljins attack is confusing5 This AUPH representative stated that Bob Duggan has been supportive of the company In addition they stated they cant imagine other top holders giving Iljin such a disproportionate number of seats on the board
SteveTexans,True,2019-06-04 10:31:00,6.505,AUPH I am fundamentals financial guy AUPH already described approx market size for both VOC and VOS but Glickman when pressured during conf by investors didnt give amount per dosage application revenue generated We need to know expected sales dollars this is how you obtain accurate BO price I would like to see from Greenleaf in presentation slide on clear financials expectations from VOC and VOS otherwise it is ALL speculative at this point CFO and VP Marketing need to come to agreement

Lunacy,,2019-06-04 10:09:00,6.507,AUPH Look at thisthis just feels like old school propaganda1 If compensation is high provide examples of how it doesnt match up to industry standards2 Failure to oversee and control expenditures just seems like a flat out lie Theyve been very judicious with their spending as theyve launched a PH3 global trial and added 2 new indications Have you ever heard an analysts say that compensation or expenses are out of whack
