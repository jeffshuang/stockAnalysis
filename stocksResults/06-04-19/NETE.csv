ScurryLaw,,2019-06-04 14:34:00,4.003,NETE I just compared this with RIOT because I see the comparison a lot on this chain For 2018 NETE had about ten times the revenues and 5 times the gross profit on the revenues The net loss for NETE was about 5 million and the net loss for RIOT was about 58 million Yet RIOT has a 50 million dollar market cap and NETE has a 16 million dollar market cap The companies are different but NETE incorporates blockchain into a broader services I still believe this is massively undervalued compared to other companies But for the life of me I cant understand why the stock price doesnt reflect as much I have to be missing something in these reports
