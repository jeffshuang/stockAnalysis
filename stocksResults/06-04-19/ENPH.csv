RomanEmpire2019,True,2019-06-04 14:13:00,15.98,ENPH in my own personal opinion not that I am any professional but I think Enphase will continue to melt up It is not so much the people that are buying the stock as it is the shorts that continue to hold their position The money is trading hands 2 years ago all the Bulls were losing their money to shorts Going forward it will be the shorts losing money to the Bulls Again this is my own opinion I think it continues to trickle up but there will be bumps in the road With that said I continue to buy call options at the start of each month Why not Even if it doesnt hit the strike price it is still making money BOOYAH

WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-06-04 12:39:00,15.915,SPWR ENPH very nice to see SPWR pop today related to relief rally on hopes that Mexico tariffs wont happen Im guessing as autos are all up big as well SPWR is a riskier play than ENPH but if they can actually deliver the stock will move significantly Very beaten down currently and for good reason but if solar continues to take off next year SPWR should benefit significantly
