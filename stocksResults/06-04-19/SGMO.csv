JustTradingHoy,,2019-06-04 14:23:00,9.16,SGMO the run will start on the third or fourth week of June on the days leading to the Gene Editing Conference in DownUnder Wall Street is not interested in holding these types of stocks any longer than a week or two as they have shown in the last 23 years Wall Street are short term traders by nature when it comes to biotech So jump ahead start nibbling this week and next ahead of them Then sell on the day prior of the actual SGMO presentation If interested long term then ride the profits keep those fully invested In my opinion for this strategy to work and maximize the desire outcome youll need to buy 2X 3X 5x or preferring 10X the intended position that you ultimately want to hold LT after you pull out hopefully with gain before the events Be ready for sleepless night and algos scare action tactics Good Luck
