btdiver,True,2019-06-04 11:06:00,3.99,GALT For some time now Ive been hoping that a new CEO would be brought in someone who has selling ability charisma Im sure Harold is a very nice man but he has at best been an obedient soldier at worst hes been just going through the motions Everything in business is a sale no matter what youre doing youre selling The most introverted employees have to at a minimum sell their work product to their manager its no coincidence that those that are the best at selling make the most money Harold is not a salesman Other than Uihlein and Czirr GALT has no one with any ability to articulate GALTs promise Unless you count Back Bay and I have no idea what theyve been doing as there is no one in management selling the GALT promise the stock price languishes Strong salespeople create demand for something Even more impactful than the manipulation bear raids the lack of salesmanship has held this back Its high time for a change

ChoppedLiver1,,2019-06-04 09:35:00,4.016,GALT Such fanboy excitement over SEC filings for the Rights Offering purchases disclosed by Richard Uihlein in April Does anyone actually think this is new information As for the BOD buys why didnt all of them oversubscribe The actual best news out of this is that Shlevin didnt buy anything that undoubtedly means he is on his way out and a new hopefully committed CEO will be announced shortly If its the right hire and he makes a share purchase upon hire that is a big step forward
