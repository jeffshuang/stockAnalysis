AmyJack,,2019-06-04 12:03:00,38.21,COUP OKTA SMAR Do I sense a major sea change in the valuations of the hot cloud sector Maybe In case of multiple contraction in the market for whatever reasons what used to be good say a pricetosales ratio of 36 no longer holds Then it will adjust to a newly set valuation Most bulls do not realize it until too late though It may be the case or it just may be a day of profit taking we will see

neil30,True,2019-06-04 10:40:00,38.596,SMAR direction all boils down to earnings report I remember during the conference call last quarter an analyst referred to the quarter as phenomenal Not sure why this consolidated with such phenomenal growth but I think if we get back to back phenomenal quarters the stock should run After the initial report last quarter the stock ran up as high as 49 a share before getting beaten down Just dont understand why its struggling here
gsharofsky,True,2019-06-04 10:22:00,38.652,SMAR Solid company but the stock direction says different
