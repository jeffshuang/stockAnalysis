tradeintherain,,2019-06-04 15:38:00,0.7533,LTBR EXC Im sorry Mr Greenlee If you want us you will pay for us And the Atari leveraged counterfeit FederalReserveBux lowball shitbid of 075 is not the price
BusinessClass,,2019-06-04 14:43:00,0.749,I would hope LTBR either produces a rod andor secures a utility contract BEFORE they reapply for the DOE grant by 7312019 If there is no meaningful milestone before then the viability of this company and most certainly a grant award is called into question I realize they got a GAIN voucher but the DOE grant reviewers place much greater scrutiny on commercial viability whereas the voucher merely attests to scientific merit which no one doubts Regardless of the specific weaknesses the DOE calls out at the core of the issue is whether or not this fuel is commercially viable and without a contract as well as an actual manufactured contract it is much easier to nitpick
ECerus,,2019-06-04 13:12:00,0.7755,LTBR PS NuScale fuel bundles are halfsize of standard PWR bundles which of course Fram is currently manufacturing with LEU So this means that Fram has to sell twice as many but then there will be a geometric rise in number of reactors I like that math
