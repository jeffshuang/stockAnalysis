RobertoRusso,,2019-06-04 11:40:00,19.212,UGAZ bears are nowhere to be found on the 5 minute since the last dump to test yesterdays low A few more 5 minute bars and I say we break through 243 Patience needed here
FloridaNewf,,2019-06-04 11:34:00,19.321,UGAZ Not bad the big run up to a blistering 2428 Was 263 about 45 trading days ago so still tons of room above Hopefully the arse just does not come out of it any more ha GL
ChartMill,,2019-06-04 11:33:00,19.335,The technical rating of UGAZ is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment chartmillcomanalyzephpu
RobertoRusso,,2019-06-04 11:28:00,19.28,UGAZ Big Bullish engulfing on the 4 hour with volume behind it Next target to break through is 243 then 245 Should make a stop there to consolidate but Im eyeing 25 by tomorrow

bearsack,,2019-06-04 10:41:00,18.92,UGAZ DGAZ Like I saidstill very on overall trend But NG likes to have her fun in between What better way to reset the intras for another drop than to force scared s to cover That divergence is going to rip intraday Good opportunity to short the spike incoming
NaturalBornTrader,,2019-06-04 10:23:00,19.07,UGAZ Lower highs today and officially printed a lower low by 1 tick still bearish imo
UniquelyJames,,2019-06-04 10:08:00,19.072,Wow i thought UGAZ would be dropping a bit more into the 17s today Hopefully it doesnt do that for anyone but i would have been prepared if it did Good luck out there today
