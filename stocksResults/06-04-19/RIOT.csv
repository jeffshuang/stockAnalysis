ScurryLaw,,2019-06-04 14:34:00,3.17,NETE I just compared this with RIOT because I see the comparison a lot on this chain For 2018 NETE had about ten times the revenues and 5 times the gross profit on the revenues The net loss for NETE was about 5 million and the net loss for RIOT was about 58 million Yet RIOT has a 50 million dollar market cap and NETE has a 16 million dollar market cap The companies are different but NETE incorporates blockchain into a broader services I still believe this is massively undervalued compared to other companies But for the life of me I cant understand why the stock price doesnt reflect as much I have to be missing something in these reports

BartDavis,False,2019-06-04 11:32:00,3.179,RIOT Looks like Chang and the rest of those scammers are waiting for the right time to dilute more This stock is so dead right now If they did another decent dump would cause an instant 1520 drop
tedt1,,2019-06-04 09:55:00,3.12,RIOT Dont forget in addition to the company diluting as fast as they can on the market there are also 2 million warrants that can be exercised at 194 next month adding even more dilution Wont stay above 2
