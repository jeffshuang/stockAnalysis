matty5,,2019-06-04 15:26:00,9.2,RRTS I started replenishing the half I sold in the high 9s Too early it looks like
matty5,,2019-06-04 14:18:00,9.205,RRTS no disrespect IMO you cannot not trade 40 percent moves if you see them coming If anything I didnt sell enough and began buying it back too soon
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:55:00,9.12,RRTS For those of you who actually get it Ill see you in Q2
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:54:00,9.12,RRTS The move to 1300 was just as meaningless as the move to where we are now has been Its all stockbitches playing games in their Etrade accounts theres no real money trading this
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:53:00,9.12,RRTS It hasnt even been a full quarter since the rights offering completed If you cant stomach the price volatility on 100k dollars traded daily with no actual change in the business besides some mean reversion in spot rates expected i might add save yourself the stress and get out now
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:51:00,9.12,RRTS Additionally if youre selling based on a chart or some anecdotal evidence that you heard from your cousin whose brother knows a roadrunner driverdont come back
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:50:00,9.12,RRTS Even in managements guide they have 100M EBITDA on flat top line flat top line over a two year period is quite a conservative assumption
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:50:00,9.12,RRTS The upside is all in margin expansion and operating the business more efficiently this will realize higher equity value regardless of the macro backdrop if that comes to fruition
RRTSBurner,,2019-06-04 13:49:00,9.12,RRTS Honestly if youre in this name because of some chart you looked at or some expectation of trucking rates persisting at 2018 levels youre just not going to have a good time and you might as well get out now
