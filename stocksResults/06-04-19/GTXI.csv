Ashbee,,2019-06-04 15:24:00,1.258,GTXI sold most of my shares in the after hours yesterday Guess that was a good call for now I just couldnt come a conclusion on what the price would end up being for me with the reverse split immediately before the merger and then the smaller percentage that GTXI holders get of the remaining shares after merger Kind of of a double reverse split if you will ONCT has a great pipeline though so even new bagholders have something to look forward too Might even get another bump tomorrow if volume plays nice
