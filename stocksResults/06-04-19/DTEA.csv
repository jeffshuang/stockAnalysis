BloomerCricket,True,2019-06-04 15:01:00,1.158,DTEA NEPT HEXO ACB DTEA trading 13 of BV trading near 12 of cash Why Look at chart Last Oct it spiked up hard AH on CBD rumor Every trader on the planet Earth got some and it went back down on CEO saying no CBD yet as it was not even legal yet Traders hate it because it was HIGH when they bot it Now it trades at 35 of is BV Buy the value not the spike There is plenty of value here and it will be seen and captured and the people that bot the spike last time WILL chase it again and again and again The 89 yr old CEO will retire very soon3 BO target is minimum 15 BV or above 5 Any CBD in the future and its 15 It never ever should have been below 245 except for bad market psychology and traders hate Study the undervaluation here my scanner says it trades in the 93 percentile of most UNDERVALUED stocks in the Nasdaq
BloomerCricket,True,2019-06-04 11:16:00,1.15,DTEA NEPT HEXO ACB look at chart of DTEA oversold but getting accumulated this morning and just starting 89 old CEO about to retire and that news puts this back to BV around 325 242 operating stores and 42M cash on hand with high probability of CBD in future Its a steal down here Do your DD get in early 12M trading float of 24M OS The rest are insider held from 2160 and ZERO selling Use your head when value lays right before your eyes
