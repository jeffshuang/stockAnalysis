StocksRup,True,2019-06-04 13:10:00,20.467,TXMD Just some food for though CARA which is the company I once invested in and made a good amount of profit They were trying for multiple indications of their lead drug but only one has really proven successful it has a 500m peak sales for its anti itch indication for dialysis patients experiencing pruritus strong chance for FDA approval They currently have and 800 million market cap Unless they pull out some new trail data its a going to be a onetrick pony The reason I bring this up is because our company TXMD Has three drugs with all potential of creating 500m in peak sales and we are valued at less market cap Not to mention all three of our drugs are already FDAapproved and two of them are already launched Let those valuation numbers sink in for a moment
