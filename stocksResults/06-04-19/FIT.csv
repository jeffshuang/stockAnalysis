paulcrandall,,2019-06-04 14:41:00,4.525,FIT if anybody wants the bottom line on shortselling here it is Joe Kennedy made a hundred million dollars shorting the stock market during the great depression Shortly after the depression they made Joe Kennedy the chairman of the SEC and he immediately created the uptick rule which prevented naked shortselling That rule stayed in effect until 2007 and was removed just before the market collapse of 2008 and 2009 if a player or institution has enough money and can do naked shortselling they can take any stock to zero this is what they did to the financial institutions in 2008 Lehman Brothers bear Stearns citigroup and the rest Fitbit should be eight to ten dollars easily instead the shorts can take it down to whatever price they want Should be and was illegal for 8 decades after the great depression
