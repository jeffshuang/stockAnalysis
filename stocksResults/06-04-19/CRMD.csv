issapunk,True,2019-06-04 15:08:00,6.12,CRMD My only major problem with management and its highlighted in the email I sent and posted earlier is their lack of willingness to provide any clear timelines everything is vague which in the downtrend hurts us so much If they were clearer about the timeframes I bet we could be in the 8 range right now That being said I am very happy the data analysis has been completed and will be discussed with the FDA at the next meeting I just wish we knew the window of WHEN that meeting will occur

ImExcited,True,2019-06-04 10:13:00,6.02,CRMD In my mind my opinion Khoso knew about the 2 month bleed of the shareholders and is involved with laundered dumping by banksMMs He never really gave a sensible explanation of the RS and this bleed would not have been sustainable without it On the positive side I have no doubt he has been put in charge of the Amazon of the Bio industry He knows he can get away with a lot because he is sitting on pocket aces
