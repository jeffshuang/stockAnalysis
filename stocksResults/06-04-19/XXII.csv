Congostockchat,,2019-06-04 12:59:00,1.915,XXII while XXII shareholders should be preparing for approval and an explosion in this stock price I think big tobacco shareholders should be running for their very lives When you look at things like iqos and how it is selling even in a mature market now it can best be described as big tobacco flop of the century and big tobacco becomes little tobacco People are just not going to go out and spend that kind of money for some easy bake oven nicotine contraption machine if you hand them a pack of a vln cigarettes that is 100 a cigarette except it just loses the addiction that is what theyre going to choose This is like the biggest nobrainer I have ever seen Report from Japan are showing iqos with only a 10 market share That is a total flop folks especially when you consider this is supposed to be big tobaccos nuclear weapon Its more like a kids sparkler on the 4th of July Prepare for approval Prepare for XXII to become big tobacco

Congostockchat,True,2019-06-04 11:51:00,1.91,XXII you know what is so crazy about all this Just a 1 market share of the tobacco industry will make this a 50 stock And when I talk to current smokers about this product I am not hearing 1 interest I am hearing upwards of 80 interest And so it might sound crazy it might sound pump tastic but those numbers suggest this stock could see 200 300 even 400 per share And today we are at a 190
Congostockchat,True,2019-06-04 11:46:00,1.902,XXII lets just summarize where things stand If the FDA does not approve this product there is no Vln policy We are the policy And so Prepare for approval Coming soon folks Really really really really soon In the meantime enjoy the nice summer weather
