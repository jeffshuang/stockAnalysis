aaron03,,2019-06-04 11:49:00,1.86,ONCY Makes zero sense Yesterday was a fantastic day and the market was soso The market today has been great and were currently red Albeit on low volume Frustrating to say the least
vfxcreator,True,2019-06-04 09:52:00,1.89,ONCY i was going to get giddy about yesterdays rise but i think all that volume was just the regulars here getting antsy Pi want to see some 100k volume days and that should tell us something is coming though we did have that in april and it went nowhere
