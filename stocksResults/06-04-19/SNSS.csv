Eddie2018,,2019-06-04 14:13:00,0.815,SNSS Another one keep in mind is BTK inhibitor takes time to work out Some patients from stable disease to partial response to complete response 100mg is not the limit They can dose escalate up to 500mg if safety is still fine at 500mg
Eddie2018,,2019-06-04 14:11:00,0.8152,SNSS All depends on expectation of data at 100mg It is unlikely to have robust response PR or CR at 100mg just from the tone of the conference call and generally lack of excitement But will it start to show tumor reductions in some patients Wait and see How good is promising
