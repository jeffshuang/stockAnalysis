9CrazyFingers,,2019-06-04 15:17:00,1.951,VUZI who is tipping off the shorts Or are the insiders the big short
dino068,,2019-06-04 15:11:00,1.954,VUZI this board is funny PT buys 5000 shares and gets paid more than 500k No revenue with only loses Great BOD They let this go on INTC is fortunate they have money to pay preferred
9CrazyFingers,,2019-06-04 14:58:00,1.962,VUZI If I understand this correct this is NOT a raise So the short theory is dog food Is this the right assumption of the shelf Because it definitely gives them all the money they will need Now we need the shorts to cover and to get real investorsand one whopper of a contract
9CrazyFingers,,2019-06-04 14:42:00,1.964,VUZI If PT bought shares then I guess an investment partner deal is not imminentOr he would not have been allowed to buy
randcap,True,2019-06-04 14:16:00,1.99,VUZI financial situation turning They came to terms with the raise Stock needs that clarity to move forward Paul bought more Now only thing left is for Paul to take a 1 annual salary effective immediately and concentrate on shareholder value
