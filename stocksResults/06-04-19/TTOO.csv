EquiStar,True,2019-06-04 14:54:00,1.84,TTOO if any longs have margin accounts here make sure to place sell limit order well above current price so that your shares cannot be lent out Prime brokers will lend them out to shorts 7 times over got my powder ready for sub 175

hpesojnhoj,False,2019-06-04 13:41:00,1.86,TTOO i dumped this junk this AM glad I did this is going nowhere but down
EquiStar,True,2019-06-04 10:31:00,1.9,TTOO if they push this to 100 my God what a gift Folks even if Cash is not adequate like management says for 2019 the company has numerous opportunities to raise cash without dilution research dealsmany other companies can use machine to develop their own drugs or therapies secondly Lyme panel is worth at least triple the market cap Could partner or sell these off dont believe the lies by shorts
EquiStar,,2019-06-04 10:01:00,1.899,TTOO folks if you watch level 2 you can sell all of the small lotsindicative of shorting either by shorts or MM but in the case most likely shorts
Esau815,,2019-06-04 09:31:00,1.9,TTOO The converse of course is also true If TTOO doesnt hit that guidance it means that management loses its credibility and this stock is looking at a 40MM debt with a negative cash flow So what it comes down to with TTOO is that it basically has 8 months enough time for JPM 2020 to either put up or shut up
