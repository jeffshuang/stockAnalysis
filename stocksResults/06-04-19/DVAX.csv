HyacinthCohen,False,2019-06-04 10:43:00,4.42,DVAX most of your comments are correct Bigpharma does want to buy sd101 but not at premium price200 million They want it at a discount price of 25 million Why pay premium price when you can wait and buy it at a discount This is how execs think when dealing with companies like dvax and the situation they are in
JustAnotherInvestor,True,2019-06-04 10:42:00,4.42,DVAX getting hammered today Seemingly for better news than what drove us up 18 premarket a year ago at 2018 ASCO People are making the argument that the inverse ratio of dosage results seems to show that maybe SD101 is getting in the way of Keytruda How could that be Keytruda has results of 37 ORR alone as a treatment Evidently Keytruda magically became double as effective with no help or support from SD101 Seems likelyObviously Dynavax management is worried about the 30M revenue target in 2019 and thats why they streamlined their company It has to be strategic why they shut down further development of SD101 AFTER they saw the data Time will tell
