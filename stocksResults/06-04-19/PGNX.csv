YazzJr,,2019-06-04 13:00:00,4.3,PGNX I have a feeling that PGNXs BOD are sweating their jobs a bit here I am also sure that Velan has made numerous phone calls to the other funds with their plan for PGNX I am sure that plan includes beefing up the share price a bit and then selling the company for a premium With Velans past successes in doing that I am sure the other funds are probably listening at least a little
YazzJr,,2019-06-04 12:38:00,4.29,PGNX PGNX is really trying to drum up the votes here so maybe they are sweating this out a bit Maybe the big shareholders are aligning themselves up with Velan If PGNX management felt really secure about getting the votes they need they wouldnt be bothering with responding to Velans every qualm

st6387,,2019-06-04 11:38:00,4.315,PGNX It is appalling to me that the Chairman of the Board owns zero shares Why arent there any insider purchases of stock ever especially now with the price in the dumps and the Board stating everything is awesome Their actions speak volumes
