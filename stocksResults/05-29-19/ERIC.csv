FJSCapital11,,2019-05-29 11:43:00,9.595,ERIC 10000 shares stronger 60000 long PT still 1050 mid next month agree with merills 1140 I believe it will actually hit far higher than that but not until late 2019 or 2020
prostockalerts,True,2019-05-29 11:18:00,9.626,ERIC NOK id just buy now or get long calls like 2020 Both of these have great deals lining up and a solid future of growth for the company Expect ERIC at 12s by EOY and NOK at 6s by EOY Out of the two prefer ERIC except for its weirdly manipulated stock as you can see in the charts but itll still have long term growth
