bwhipple,,2019-05-29 13:38:00,0.7601,SPHS The open mistrust of shareholders for management did not begin with shareholders It is the result of longterm mismanagement
bwhipple,,2019-05-29 13:33:00,0.7601,SPHS We all know we have an ace team Why is the price being allowed to stay this low No deal can pull the SP out of this hole It is not done Why is management so silent for so long Why have they buried previous PRs The price being this low cannot be construed as healthy or as evidence of adroit management by our executives or as guided by Cooley

perfectvision,,2019-05-29 09:54:00,0.79,SPHS The main direction I see them going here is a partnership But my guess is to get the 5060 million for runway and trial they will need to give up US rights or Outside US rights They may be able to get 10 royalties thrown in and if they are smart they will try to get a ridiculously high milestone payment thrown in that is highly unobtainable Something like 1 billion milestone if sales exceed 5 billion a year They will keep milestones confidential but it will at least look like a 50 million upfront and 1 billion in milestones deal
perfectvision,,2019-05-29 09:46:00,0.7963,SPHS I see a lot of talk about RS and dilute but that really doesnt do much for them The delisting is partially because they are under 35 million market cap An RS wont change that They also still can only dilute 13rd of market cap according to their shelf and an RS doesnt change that market cap This is why I have been saying p3 funding through dilution is virtually impossible
