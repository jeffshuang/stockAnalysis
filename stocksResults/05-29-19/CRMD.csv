issapunk,True,2019-05-29 15:42:00,6.85,CRMD Whats the reason Cormedix has virtually zero sales in Europe It is simple Europe uses Citralock as their catheter locking solution It is cheap and works ok They do not use Heparin The US does use Heparin and Citralock is not approved nor close to approval This is important because hospitals in the US will only have to purchase a different product Neutrolin and use that in place of the Heparin solution they have always used So when bears use the Euro market as a sticking point understand it is comparing apples to oranges and Cormedix never stood a chance in that market nor did they really expect to The US is where Neutrolin will be valued
btdb,,2019-05-29 15:28:00,6.8,CRMD our share price sucks because of a bad financing a reverse split zero Wall Street connections history of poor management If you are long here you should know that You are betting that Khoso and the gang can do an adequate job of filing the appropriate paper work and that the FDA will approve Neutrolin in minimally hemodialysis but hopefully all catheter locks Without WS relationships tutes arent going to be breaking down the doors but rather look with suspicion at the history of Cora Tellez and Khoso as well as a double warrant financing with Wainright They will not take a risk in that context You and I are taking a risk in that context While Ive never been impressed with management now or when Milby was in I believe they will manage to file the paper work Time will tell but thats the bet In the interim the shorts are in charge

bujer,,2019-05-29 15:25:00,6.78,CRMD if you have questions about Europe sales go read Seeking Alpha article and all of the comments from people in the know
cobragene,,2019-05-29 14:59:00,6.81,CRMD As I am holding more shares then I care to say I need a good answer as to the low EU Sales Can someone inform me why EU sales havent skyrocketed
issapunk,True,2019-05-29 14:37:00,6.819,CRMD is there any chance that the next meeting with the FDA does not result in news regarding the NDA good or bad Will we 100 have an answer whenever the meeting does actually go off
CramerShouldHaveListened,True,2019-05-29 14:36:00,6.819,CRMD The FDA meeting is scheduled and is inevitable Reread the last conf calm transcript if you need faith We will be asking for a green light to file under LPAD and blessing We should get it hands down Meeting should be soon FDA is a process Very likely Buyers will be rewarded at these levels
TMLEVERAGE,True,2019-05-29 14:33:00,6.849,CRMD Dont get me wrong this will be the shiniest from the past years polishing lol
tballgame,,2019-05-29 14:28:00,6.85,CRMD if you are long here choose to think positive A lot of great things going for this company Stock price is down over past 3months but also look at the change in volatility Fundamentally the companys position has improved and we are at the next steps with DrMounts and the CRMD teams working relationship with FDA This is a new drug applying to come on the market It takes time And finally consider the overall climate of the global economics markets and political landscape right now There are a lot of distractions and emotions flying around right now CRMD volume remains very low and off the radar hence its falling accumulation Be patient and try to avoid the emotional addictives that are seemingly everywhere GLTA

CramerShouldHaveListened,True,2019-05-29 12:18:00,6.745,CRMD gotta imagine that unless insiders are restricted from buying we should see some here The whole market is red cant wait for the darn FDA meeting Trying to add more and dollar cost average as study results were too good and FDA has been on our side the whole time with LPAD fast track QIDP and providing face to face meetings with each request Just a process at this point to get application finished

mcturner146,,2019-05-29 12:14:00,6.746,CRMD after discussing with my wife after seeing multiple post here about being able to mix this yourself 1 currently only doctors can purchase ingredients and mix it themselves pharmacist cant 2 making anything with heparin makes heparin non functional 3 if this solution is mixed and allows heparin to continue to work in its capacity she says it is a game changer and believes that it would be bought and used in many other situations than just dialysis She has been a nurse for many years and has worked in ICU as well as cardiology setting and has personally used heparin to lock catheters ports etc I trust her opinion and when I shows her the data of 78 effective rate vs heparin alone she said do not sell his stock it will take off when approved

Cooch111,,2019-05-29 11:34:00,6.813,CRMD why do people keep adding buys this as it fades into oblivion especially since no REAL recent insider buyssupport Going to 4 5 or 6 doesnt make the valuation any cheaper without FDA approval Wait for approval and then load up Youre not gonna miss the boat If it gets approved and you buy at 14 your shares are only more valuable
