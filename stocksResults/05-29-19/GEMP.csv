hopeandresearch,,2019-05-29 12:09:00,0.913,GEMP i still believe this stock should be much higher It went from around 8 to 1 with one negative result from pediatric NASH stemming from patients who we later discovered did not take Gemcabene as directed The other big drop came after the hold was continued forcing a delay to phase 3 The subsequent dog and monkey study apparently had no negative results and the KO mice study is likely ongoing Am I crazy to firmly believe the test results will be good based upon previous resultsNow we await the FLP results as the stuck plummets for no material reason other than dead silence from management and the market being hit
