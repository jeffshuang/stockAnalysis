cmlkm,,2019-05-29 14:35:00,5.341,DVAX I dont think I have the ability to hold anymore Not because of shorts but because I over leveraged and this stock has destroyed my account and now I need what I have left to use for other endeavors Also have taken horrible losses elsewhere Has been a bad couple years for me Price of learning to trade the markets I guess

poorguy,True,2019-05-29 12:55:00,5.21,DVAX short seller has been selling this stock for a long time based on their justification which may or may not true wait for the next couple of months then the market will show up and no sense we sell our shares at this pricebut keep in mind if DVAX will show the investors that they are making progress financially after restructuring which would not be that far then short sellers have to buy back FYI more than 25 million of common shares of DVAX are short
