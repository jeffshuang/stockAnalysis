Scarliver,,2019-05-29 14:07:00,4.04,GALT Hey chopped brains Some of us fanboys are investors who see an unusual opportunity here I guess we will just have to wait and see how this all plays out Suggest you reread your posts You sound very angry Feel sorry for you Must suck to be you and live life with your angry demeanor
ChoppedLiver1,,2019-05-29 12:26:00,4.03,GALT How many fanboys know Richard Uihlein sold almost 2M GALT shares 239 in May 2017 leaving him with 750000 contentarchivefastedgarSo much for the theory that he is a long time long who would never sell a share under any circumstances
Scarliver,,2019-05-29 11:39:00,4.03,GALT Why is this stock so heavily shorted Why is progress that can potentially save lives being stymied Why have so called pundits like Adam Feuerstein with no scientific background allowed to round up thousands of people and short this stock and keep an advance from moving forward Why is there a need for heroes like DU to save the day Peoples lives are hanging in the balance with no cure in sight for late stage NASH and this company is being held hostage by shorts
DeeLowu235,,2019-05-29 11:37:00,4.03,GALT Did you all forget this is a micro cap Acting like you never watched a micro under pressure Stock is separate from company
StopaGE,False,2019-05-29 11:21:00,4.01,GALT Then why no BP Why is no one buying up this stock Why was RO heavily undersubscribed Why does the SP kep plummeting every day Does this board know that much more than all of the industry experts
Tigergalt,True,2019-05-29 11:19:00,3.999,GALT Why your pumpers are continuing doing the PR for this company while themselves are silent asf Shut the f up We dont need your bs want to see the company stop being to damn silent
D_Coral,True,2019-05-29 10:54:00,4.02,GALT Scarliver so interesting that in the beginning the bashers insisted that Galectin3 is not important Now there are thousands of papers about the critical role of Galectin3 in the disease process many published in the most prestigious journal Nature this year When the bashers lose their argument they craft a ridiculous new one with zero scientificmedical basis But the shorts cant go up against the team that helped with the Nobel Prize in Medicine at Chiles Research Center so they turn to financials But then we have billionaire Richard Uihlein as a hardcore backer and a new capital infusion after the RO so the shorts are toast
Scarliver,,2019-05-29 10:45:00,4,GALT History of GALT short rants Sugar Pill apple cider Gal 3 is nonsense GR 2 is not a blocker no money burning money in the fire Now the rant is fan boys and fantasy investing P2 failed years to go before P3 completion Not too much substance in their short rants
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-05-29 10:03:00,4.03,GALT It is time to wake up people When I read someone say GALT is down 30 since February thats great info but also take a look at the ENTIRE MARKET and the NASH SECTOR ICPT alone is down 30 If it isnt obvious to you yet a recession is in the making The market is going to drop gradually especially with the current political agendas at play GALT is not going to skyrocket unless there is a major binary event we know that We also know that the probability of a major binary event is relatively high it is NOT a matter of if but when And boy oh boy WHEN it does comeChoppy you will officially become a chopped liver and be fed to the hyenas GL to the true longs
ZachPed,,2019-05-29 09:33:00,4.05,GALT anyone know when to expect RO to actually transact
