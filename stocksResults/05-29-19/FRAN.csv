Kiko07,,2019-05-29 14:40:00,0.4758,FRAN really surprised Pendergast hasnt been hired by a bigger company yet The turnaround since his hiring has been spectacular At this pace he will be looking for another job very quickly since he will be unemployed soon I will make sure I follow him and short the stock he will be involved next Guaranteed profit
Kiko07,,2019-05-29 14:30:00,0.48,FRAN this is like an auction but the other way around The auctioneer at 48 says do I hear 47 and after 46 until its sold for 0 But its the shorts isnt it There is shorts because theres no longs At least strong longs
Bahner99,,2019-05-29 13:30:00,0.49,FRAN when is the next ER
investhedge,True,2019-05-29 13:24:00,0.4888,FRAN they took sp down all way from 8 to 60 in six months they will be forced to take this back sooner than later
Marlow1966,,2019-05-29 13:01:00,0.4898,FRAN What shorts dont recognize is the number they pushed this to 17 million market cap when the company shows they made a profit the Q34 losses in the 10s of millions are gone 40 mil combined loss those 2 Qs sales are up and BK is out of the picture not that it ever was and they have what lets say 2025 mil in cash and book value 2 that will just be ignored You think this is being collected for kicks for a pump and dump How naive Keep an eye as you push it just what that MC number is At some point no matter what a sector is being shorted to you cannot short something just because when the numbers dont add up in your favor
autumn1962,True,2019-05-29 12:54:00,0.487,FRAN You can always tell when someone has reached their max pain tolerance level They get in here and start crying
Kiko07,,2019-05-29 11:58:00,0.4911,FRAN funny how this longs keep calling me names but they dont want to talk fact And the fact is Fran is at an all time low no buys from management nothing from Rothschild although they are getting payed and no plan for the future Anyone wanna discuss facts
Kiko07,,2019-05-29 11:19:00,0.5029,FRAN hows that strategic review Pendergast After 5 months and 3 of the value of Fran spent and nothing Keep giving Rothschild money and your friend Maybe you should bring some more outside advisors and spend some more money on them
RowanG,,2019-05-29 10:20:00,0.4967,FRAN Wow a week later and still my prediction is happening Goes to show you cant rely on Insider buying to predict price The shorts have control
Zublos,True,2019-05-29 10:01:00,0.4942,FRAN markets down We could even see it going down to 04 Will be dead until we get some news If the turnaround plan is working this stock will be 1 Next quarter is crucial for the future of this company Im holding and if it goes down to 045 or more im adding
