ohshit,,2019-05-29 15:29:00,0.688,TBLT here is the reason i own this stock it has nothing to do with charts spreadsheets or reviews i think outside the stock box imo this is a future virtual money making machine simply because of the smart way they are doing business yes they are young and will make mistakes but here is what i see the company only has about 20 us employees and its because they design it and test it here and have their shit made overseas by somebody else no 2 billion dollar factory to maintain and pay for no 500 employees to insure no trucks to deliver they are keeping their overhead down to next to nothing but yet they are cranking out big time product and expanding sales clients at a tremendous rate and constantly developing more at a very nice profit im sure within a year this will be in the sights of some very large investors due to cost of operation to profit ratio little company big profit fits right into my interests
