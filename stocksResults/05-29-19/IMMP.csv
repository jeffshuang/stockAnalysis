SeaTownGreen,True,2019-05-29 10:51:00,1.96,IMMP I think the May investor presentation was extremely impressive It shows a large effort from a little company with blockbuster potential for efti Its timing likely has to do with ASCO not fitting with current clinical updates INSIGHT data not ready TACTI002 not ready and AIPAC as we all know could be as late as early next year IMP761 has huge promise and in my mind just piles on the value I feel like were about to turn a corner but ASCO is about partnered and competitor programs turning over the LAG3 cards Zero volume this week tells me Im probably right
