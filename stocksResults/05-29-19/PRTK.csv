bigchops24,,2019-05-29 15:09:00,4.08,PRTK and KALA considering both here
AlphaGains,,2019-05-29 14:49:00,4.1,PRTK not saying much but probably the best recovery weve seen in a couple months
Antihydrogen,,2019-05-29 12:59:00,3.985,PRTK Whos losing faith You Not me
gbtrade,True,2019-05-29 12:42:00,3.971,PRTK i know there are those who are losing faith but this is not the time to sell especially when its clearly a market wide down turn Dont blame this stock for the recent declines when you can see the correlation between the pt and erratic market newd Always has been a longterm play
CPKC,,2019-05-29 12:27:00,3.985,PRTK well hello Mr 3s
mbzwrd,,2019-05-29 12:27:00,3.985,PRTK how low can this go doubled down at 10 and again at 6 but cant keep chasing even at this silly price
Deep_Value,,2019-05-29 12:22:00,3.987,PRTK Out of my entire position in the upper 390s Fully aware that is near the 52 wk low and this seems an absurd price for this company I just have no faith the price erosion will stop until material sales numbers and guidance are released by the company May revisit once that occurs All the best to all on this board very good group Hope this rockets back up to FDA approval pop pricing and I am dead wrong
AlphaGains,,2019-05-29 10:14:00,3.967,PRTK unfortunate it broke 4s Would hate to see that become resistance now
