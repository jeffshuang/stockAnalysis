only1de,True,2019-05-29 12:21:00,2.092,XXII question peeps Ive owned XXII since 78 and will hold for a long time Since our tobacco is not addictive and could have even been used as a cessation product before the new FDA mandate isnt by definition what XXII produces going to result in no one ever smoking again or all going to vape products I mean since they wont be addicted or get the nicotine high whatever that is wont we eventually just have no one buying because they dont need to Or are we simply saying that there will always be people that want to smoke a cigarette and others that will vape but come to our product to stop nicotine all together Just curious on others thoughts

Nickalus,,2019-05-29 10:26:00,2.172,XXII So the FDA schedule mentioned Oct as the date for mandate in the mean time we will get a ruling on both our PMTA and MRTP applications In order for the mandate to work those two apps need to be approved
dirkstockdiggler,,2019-05-29 10:01:00,2.17,Is this technology transferable to the vape space or is XXII strictly a combustible play
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-29 09:58:00,2.18,XXII if you go back and look at the date our pmta APP was submitted and sort of countdown what phase they were in since then and consider that as of the last conference call they are now in phase 4 with site inspection done I think we could literally see approval Tomorrow even The company says they expect its a happen this summer but that almost seems late compared to how quickly this is moved along I guess we will see godhelpthepanda
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-29 09:51:00,2.19,XXII I just want to say two things again folks Number one site inspection completed I bought my first stock in 1978 41 years ago Ive been fulltime in the market for the last 25 years I have never seen something with the FDA not get approved once it progressed to that level And secondly and probably even more relevant then that is this is the FDA policy The FDA came out and said all tobacco will be VLN There is no other vln besides our VLN Their policy was arrived at by using XXII technology and products And so I guess all that there is left to say is PREPARE FOR APPROVAL

dirkstockdiggler,,2019-05-29 09:44:00,2.181,XXII youve got to wonder if Panda has a summer hit piece planned leading up to approval
