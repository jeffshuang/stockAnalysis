phdiddy,,2019-05-29 14:46:00,2.38,EPIX I dont blame folks for selling over the last while but Im encouraged that the sell volume has been met with buying After all were pretty much halfway to 2020 already Various news updates should start flowing as well over summer and fall with hopefully some good booby news Despite my optimism I still reserve the right to bich when necessary ventilation is required Good day
