WantedToRetireEarly,True,2019-05-29 10:52:00,7.82,SPWR Like ENPH SPWR is looking pretty solid currently Not much selling even on down market days Volume remains pretty weak Trend is definitely bullish but will lack any real conviction until they can prove to the market that they are on the road to profitability That could easily take a few quarters or longer Will be dollar cost averaging at these levels I think downside risk is around 6 but upside could easily be 1214
