Jtt3,True,2019-05-29 09:57:00,0.5002,NVCN In all seriousness I wish Robinhood had a function that would delineate how many shares you have that have been held for longer than a year Should be simple as Robinhood utilizes FIFO exclusively So for example if you have 10000 shares of a stock but youve been accumulating it for months on months Itd be nice to be able to look at your dashboard see that you have 10000 shares and of those 10000 shares 2355 have been held for over a year Should be a simple report or script to run in the software This would make for smarter trades for those of us who hold for long periods of time
