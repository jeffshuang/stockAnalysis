ScurryLaw,,2019-05-29 14:58:00,4.091,NETE I will definitely be on the next conference call to hold management responsible if the stock price does not drastically increase between now and then My issue is not so much the decline in revenues and the stock price but the explanation of how management can take such a substantial bonus while growth is declining I also want to know whether they are open to the MA market ie a buyout as they have shown the inability to post a profit Management has not been held to the fire during these conference calls since the last time I called in not by Zacks nor any other investor That will change
