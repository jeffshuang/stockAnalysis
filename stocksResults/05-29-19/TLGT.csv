EusebioJL,,2019-05-29 15:13:00,0.71,TLGT a real shot in the arm would be a quick 100 jump in a month if future financial health issues were quelled and then from there a base could form and orphan drug AZ pipeline getting rolled out and continued product additions could get this back into 2s 3s 4s etc but alot of IFs at this point i gotta believe the orphan drug approval itself had an upfront cash pmt lined up with the partner which actually leads me to my next question is that partner shitting their pants right now because they have a pending orphan drug approval and their manufacturer who would specifically be tied to said approval might be insolvent depending on mkt size of the drug and eagerness of partner to get to mkt may lead to some sort of investment into TLGT
EusebioJL,,2019-05-29 14:55:00,0.7097,TLGT oh boy please dont print that 6X they better have exciting news on the horizon not an FDA approval for a topical cream expected to sell 500 a month new collaboration with the potential for a direct cash infusion would be HUGE FDA approval of facility could help and perhaps something of this sorts is in the works just waiting for that approval at this point organic growth might be too late to save this
