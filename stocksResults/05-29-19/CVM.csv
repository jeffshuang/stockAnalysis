FatNinjaRider,,2019-05-29 09:34:00,4.45,CVM The IDMC will meet again in August If 298 events have not yet occurred then it is likely that they will have enough data to make a determination As this is a binary event the risk is clear I think the SP will continue down a little further insiders and tutes will load more and SP will then rise as we near Aug If the trial fails expect the share price to be around 100 If it suceeds and company gets BO for 5b expect share price to be around 67
