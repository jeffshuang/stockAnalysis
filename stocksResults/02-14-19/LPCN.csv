StockMeister1,,2019-02-14 15:32:00,1.651,VKTX Why are people talking about LPCN here The real gauge of value should be based on the class of treatment TRB agonist
defyhog,,2019-02-14 15:28:00,1.66,MDGL I believe eventually VKTX prevail with its drug LPCN intriguing and may win the drag race with shorter trials
h8ster,,2019-02-14 15:10:00,1.62,LPCN the reason for the drop is fear of future dilution They will now need a ton of cash to commence the trial SharesCash

TheTradTrader,,2019-02-14 10:38:00,1.687,LPCN I think they need to shop the NASH drug now dont want to shop it if Tlando gets CRL and negotiate from a position of weakness
craig8320,,2019-02-14 10:38:00,1.687,LPCN NSPX
TheTradTrader,,2019-02-14 10:38:00,1.687,LPCN If Tlando is then they partner that and then bring their pipeline forward If Tlando gets a CRL then they are back to square 1
TheTradTrader,,2019-02-14 10:37:00,1.68,LPCN What we need is cash influx for the trials and potential Tlando marketing I think they get results of ABP and NDA and then PDUFA
TheTradTrader,,2019-02-14 10:36:00,1.68,LPCN PTB Phase 3 Tlando post phase 3 going into NDA if ABP data is NASH in phase 2 We have potential for 2 billion mkt cap
TheTradTrader,,2019-02-14 10:35:00,1.68,LPCN Our PTB drug is a 500 mil drug Tlando is a billion drug Our 2nd testosterone drug adds another 250 mil Our NASH drug billion
