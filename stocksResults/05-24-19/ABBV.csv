ScryingBiotech,True,2019-05-24 11:24:00,80.256,CYCC One last thing and then Im done for today The real blockbuster combo is fully funded by the MD Anderson agreement and will start soon Sapacitabine CYC065 in elderly AML Right now venetoclax Venclexta has that field to itself with the best BCL1 suppressor But we have the leading MCL1 suppressor out there in CYC065 Sapacitabine already proved statsig in a large Phase3 trial by doubling the complete remission rate Unfortunately it failed because the primary endpoint was OS on which it had little effect Now with CYC065 its going to succeed and put Venclexta in the dustbin of history because CYC065 will keep the cancer cells that sapacitabine kills from coming back This first trial is Phase1 and nothing special But ABBV will be watching closely and be ready to take us out
