emmanuel5,True,2019-05-24 15:26:00,2.639,CVRS I guess picking up more shares yesterday was a good move Timed it decently
allawatis,,2019-05-24 15:16:00,2.625,CVRS when does market close today same time or before
PULM,,2019-05-24 15:02:00,2.62,PULM based upon my PULM post I believe CVRS has MUCH better prospects than PULM The UP TREND has been set in place and even heavy volume UP bars not normally a good thing like 322 for CVRS show strength as they hold the lows of that bar and then move higher good sign of strength So UNTIL PULM can get into an UP trend not likely soon CVRS has my money
