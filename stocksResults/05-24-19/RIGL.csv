jcrockett870,,2019-05-24 15:39:00,2.135,RIGL pandfan wants you to believe that he is long while he is bashing every day for weeks
pandffan,,2019-05-24 14:33:00,2.075,RIGL bought enough today to get my average down to 228 I was sitting right on the bid at 202 in the PM this morning but it didnt fill its at least comforting to know that my average is not much above the CFOs and that I dont have anywhere near as much to lose as he does on the bet
pandffan,,2019-05-24 14:16:00,2.071,RIGL take comfort in the fact that the CFO bought at 213 and is also under water by thousands of dollars now
pandffan,,2019-05-24 14:10:00,2.07,RIGL valuable lesson in why you dont want to be in a stock with such a high institutional ownership to begin with bunch of ETF day traders and such are in charge here

jcrockett870,,2019-05-24 10:53:00,2.137,RIGL pandfan is not a short then why has he been bashing this company for weeks
pandffan,,2019-05-24 10:51:00,2.141,RIGL there is a more than good chance that if the DJIA drops back down on Tues or even later on today we could be right back down at 202 as I wrote congrats to all that were able to take advantage of that pop this morning
pandffan,,2019-05-24 10:49:00,2.14,RIGL I am not short I also try not to get ahead of myself right now this one is going to do pretty much whatever the DJIA and the IBB does there was a 10 pop this morning congratulations if you were able to take advantage of it as I have already written I am in at 253 so that ten percent didnt help me at all as the Dow has dropped back down to 56 that ten percent gain has been pretty much cut in half
jcrockett870,,2019-05-24 10:31:00,2.154,RIGL how do you know that the board is all short trolls The price is up 10 and theres only two posts
