Jv007,True,2019-05-24 13:40:00,4.45,ADMA I keep scratching my head ask Do these shorts know IVIG is a life threatening med and in shortage And ADMA has a shit load ready to sell Are they trying to get the stop loss then walk away Might be a bad strategy
VoxGeorge,True,2019-05-24 13:38:00,4.461,ADMA Here Ill play Elon Musks obsession with 420 Im 420 bid for more shares GTC Hope it gets filled
R8Plus,True,2019-05-24 13:30:00,4.452,ADMA it gets interesting because we arent selling our shares for this low shorts are and when current whale decides they want more and pay premium whew will shorts get their shares from
Ronaldo86,True,2019-05-24 13:21:00,4.49,ADMA anything we see today and near term is simply the shorts thrashing around in their death throes Perceptive discharged a 4000000 share bullet into them That has to hurt Not a good way to go
bgoat8,True,2019-05-24 13:09:00,4.48,ADMA I may have to just tuck this away and quit looking til EOY Profits will come soon actually already here with 406 Average but dont want to sell early

R8Plus,True,2019-05-24 12:04:00,4.47,ADMA feeding frenzy about to start Sounder detecting approach enjoy
VoxGeorge,True,2019-05-24 12:01:00,4.487,ADMA When I buy shares for long term pull and not 3 month options then my time horizon and perspective changes I relax Suddenly the intrinsic value of the company plays a large role in the valuation of the stock price as I perceive it If another competitor wanted to start from scratch and have the collection centers and FDA approved manufacturing license for the manufacturing facility what would it cost to make it happen Thats just the beginning Add the FDA approvals as value Ivig shortagesthats a premiumThe rest is just as a natural progression in time So in my mind 6 to 8 is the real value and support in 2019 US dollarsAnything under that Ill keep adding patiently Anyone that wants to sell ADMA short under 6 be my guest Its a losing proposition imho

bullsonparade91,True,2019-05-24 10:49:00,4.52,ADMA i agree with the inversion agenda theory which is that most stock news is total bs that tries to mislead retail investors I think its a good sign that a bunch of articles were written about the public offering and none about perceptive buying 4 million shares The amount of DD on this thread is amazing and digging through the sec filings gets me excited for the next few months
