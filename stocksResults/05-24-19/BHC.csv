BizWitch,,2019-05-24 10:08:00,23.809,BHC Mgmt Im sorry to say it like this but I really I dont get this new drop to the low 20s I know Rome wasnt built in a day but its been 3 years already since Papa took over you all have gone through hell and survived it by taking the right steps but you seem to be unable to complete the turnaround by setting SP in fair levels Oh I know WS is a tough beast that whenever possible pushes you down with its horns Still too much debt they say And knowing that how about selling all noncore assets cutting off debt to ridiculous levels and keeping BL and Salix still better if the latter spinned off so as to bring more Bs in Papa you even lost your bonus Everyone is losing but shorts who periodically make a killing by bringing this from high 20s to low 20s over and over again BOD please stop the game Its obvious this needs big moves Just go for the throat
