Newbee221,True,2019-05-24 10:47:00,9.757,CLDR only reasonable explanation is that someone big wants to buy this and are resisting or INTC is
Malota,True,2019-05-24 10:45:00,9.769,CLDR this versus ROKU is the biggest joke in the market history How fundamentals and common sense do not matter at all short term but hype and grediness only that is why technical analyses has point but still I am dissapointedThis paper should valued like 100200USD if this would have the same hype as others not even 204050USD which could be relatively correct

BullRace,,2019-05-24 10:14:00,9.885,CLDR Is it a good price to buy now Afraid it will drop further if ER is not good
WolfCola,,2019-05-24 09:54:00,9.88,CLDR we are expecting a low eps because of costs from the merger We can expect a push in SP if sales beat If fear has to do with aggressive expansion Hortonworks and Cloudera are well positioned and has and will have the capital to fund the expenditure The technology will hold up This IOT data mining code analyzing product monitoring is being integrated into everything and will only continue to expand The two companies now have a broader reach This was timed precisely and well executed
