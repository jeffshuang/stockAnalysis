ryans1984,,2019-05-24 15:22:00,4.02,GALT what sucks the most about this stock is it will drop like crazy and just keep dropping whole day But if it rises it will pretty much drop back down by end of day or next day
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-05-24 14:28:00,4.082,GALT Like clockwork Rinse and repeat Shuffling of money and shaking off the weak hands Nobody likes to lose but we got a whole lot of game time left you silly sissy sellers SSS I know what I own hbu diligence
Smallfishbigpond,,2019-05-24 14:21:00,4.059,GALT bet it felt real good to sell at 390 lol
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-05-24 14:03:00,4,GALT 350 is not coming The only certain thing that is coming is DU and his bulldozer Only up from here Regardless of the daytoday price action only an unsophisticated investor would be panicking right now Obviously there is a LOT of money shuffling around Some sold because they couldnt partake in the RO but wanted the warrants so they sold and just bought back in for the sole purpose of warrants Others participated and will off shares just to keep the warrants as free money SURE these are ALL OPTIONS that we can utilize to make small shortterm profit swings I like many other astute investors here fully covered oversubscribed on top of that and even bought more open market shares close to 4 I am SUPER happy I get more shares and warrants because of the VWAP Who is going to cry and complain that the VWAP is less than the price offering of 550 A MORON or troll would Thats about it The unfounded panic attempt to bash this stock is comical to me resistant
D_Coral,True,2019-05-24 14:03:00,4,GALT The sellers right now are giving a gift to those of us who accumulate to lower our cost average Thank you for the buying opportunity I just wish that wire transfers to deposit funds would be quicker This technical day trader activity after the RO will not affect where the price goes the next few weeks The financials science clinical data fundamentals are stronger than ever
StopaGE,False,2019-05-24 13:45:00,3.953,GALT This could close below 350 at this rate No one is buying and bears are just killing it by the minute Wheres big Dick
Boss530,False,2019-05-24 13:44:00,3.937,GALT 350 coming soon
charlesharvie,,2019-05-24 13:34:00,3.987,GALT This will most likely face a ton of selling pressure at and just above the offering price Id imagine there are plenty of people that participated with excess cash with the plan of getting their money back and just hanging onto warrants Will take some pretty significant news and new buyers to break through that both of which seem unlikely until they start enrolling patients
D_Coral,True,2019-05-24 13:29:00,4.01,GALT if I could wire funds in time I would be adding more today 2 hour processing time is cutting it close Its not going to stay at this price level for much longer Fully funded start of NASH Phase 3 strong recent clinical data expanding indications backed by a billionaire activist investor and Chairman of the Board In stock investing there are no guarantees but this is the closest I have seen to easy returns given the certain news releases in the next few weeks
