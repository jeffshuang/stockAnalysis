drmine_,,2019-05-24 15:17:00,1.05,PULM my avg is 117 Will this go back up What is everyones average
PULM,,2019-05-24 15:02:00,1.05,PULM based upon my PULM post I believe CVRS has MUCH better prospects than PULM The UP TREND has been set in place and even heavy volume UP bars not normally a good thing like 322 for CVRS show strength as they hold the lows of that bar and then move higher good sign of strength So UNTIL PULM can get into an UP trend not likely soon CVRS has my money

PULM,,2019-05-24 14:56:00,1.05,PULM the zone of 106233 was clear distribution IF you stop looking at the chart with hopium in your eyes youll see the weekly bar of 3819 where supply came in confirmed by the next 3 weekly bars as well that all failed to hold after the volume came in and went right back down to test the lows at 106 The APRIL FOOLS joke weekly bar was a HUGE UPTHRUST where pros unloaded all they could on unsuspecting twits imo finishing below the weekly bar prior to it all those bag holders are S T U K stuck Hope all we want but this has MAJOR supply directly above us at the close of the APRIL FOOLS Weekly Bar 118126 I cant anything happening here until we get back ABOVE those levels and STAY THERE
