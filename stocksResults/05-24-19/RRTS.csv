matty5,,2019-05-24 15:36:00,11.599,RRTS For me trading is about accepting the situation I am in Not sunk cost or where I wish I were Truth is I have now recouped most of my losses in the account still down but only a little by accepting where I am at and trading accordingly On any one stock I make trades based on current price and where I think it will go Not as much about the cost of the original batch of shares That is history Rightwrong it is already done Cant change it

matty5,True,2019-05-24 13:56:00,11.565,RRTS I am not an investor for the most part I am a trader I hold some of my long trades for a while but I am always trading part of the position when the price points permit This one has mellowed out quite a bit Sitting tight for now
matty5,,2019-05-24 13:47:00,11.565,RRTS I am not a pattern day trader But lately it seems one could make a killing simply buying the morning dip and selling before market close every day Lots of stocks including this one The daily charts frequently have a V notch after market open
