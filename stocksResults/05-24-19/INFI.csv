Frida_m,,2019-05-24 15:36:00,1.44,INFI charts dont mean anything in biotech only RESULTS matter and cash position its a log term hold friends
Situation_Kritikal,False,2019-05-24 15:16:00,1.45,Take a look at IMRN see what terrible management and LACK OF VOLUME can do to a stock 60 drop under 6mo I predicted it just as I called SGYP to BK My eyes are now on INFI
1stOfficerStock,True,2019-05-24 13:10:00,1.455,INFI Also from last nights conference they expect first person to be dosed in Mario275 before the end of June
1stOfficerStock,True,2019-05-24 13:04:00,1.46,INFI Interesting looks like Astrazenca spent a couple million trying to create something equal to IPI549 in AZD3458 but its restricted to preclinical studies proposals only Not as selective and therefor not as safe or effective IMO No doubt IPI549 is on the short list of drugs to BO by big pharmaopeninnovationastrazeneca
Situation_Kritikal,,2019-05-24 11:04:00,1.45,INFI let the chart do the talking Downward pressure still on nothing but resistance above Youll need yuge vol to get through Maybe with PH2 we hit 160 I dont know All IMO
