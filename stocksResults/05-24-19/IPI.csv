axcapitol,True,2019-05-24 11:01:00,3.12,IPI 2nd Q results will be over the top Pent up 1Q sales that were pushed due to weather Farm aid bill and profit will start to roll in off new ranch purchase China really has nothing to do with this stock except perception At this price it is a gift Funny how the marker punishes a company for paying back debt early instead of wasting money with dividends Buybacks that are only a short term shot in the arm All the CEOs money is tied into stock price With the amount of shares he owns his pay is based on how the company does He could easily push the stock price up but he is doing the right thing and building long term value of the stock price Buy and sit and watch In a few years you will be pleased If you are a day trader this is not a stockFor you
