Norrisman,,2019-05-24 14:08:00,5.812,VHC One of the questions for KL was mine which was the second question answered and pertained to VHCs move to the NYSE KL said that the NYSE has already approached VHC and the move will happen when all parameters are met which will allow little or no short manipulation That along with the answer KL gave about dividends does not paint a pretty picture for those with short positions and IMO makes a case for a distinct short squeeze
Norrisman,,2019-05-24 14:00:00,5.84,VHC I attended the ASM yesterday front row The mood was serious which I appreciated because I do not attend ASMs for a rah rah session I sat at the breakfast table with Dr Short as he discussed the APPL trial After all was said and done I feel more confident than ever in VHC and that VHC will prevail If you have any questions please feel free to ask
WitchKingOfAngmar,True,2019-05-24 13:13:00,5.815,VHC One last comment Could not be more excited about whats coming our way All good Im letting it happen Onward now that the ASM is in the rear view mirror Daily chart Shows the sideways movement waiting for the CAFC We got the 10ma Xing below the 50ma shows traders getting tired of waiting Next support 510 then big support 460 jmo We got about a month before we hear so very possible we head that low If we hear sooner great LQQking to load up on the July Calls later in the month of June in anticipation of that event Going to be a bumpy ride no matter GL
WitchKingOfAngmar,True,2019-05-24 12:31:00,5.672,VHC I typically stay away from the garbage pits of IV and yahoo but since I met a few guys from there I thought I check out the IV board and see what they would post Boy what a surprise Typical garbage Mostly from people that did not attend Same w yahoo None from the guys I met looks like they are not going to report and I sure dont blame them Just reading the latest post from the idiot stevens guys shows how pathetic they are Ill stick by what I wrote I think not only fair but accurate I see he did not get past the first word I see parsing the work subdued a lot Good Subdued quiet and rather reflective Exactly how I felt coming out of the ASM And yes I did talk with Dr Short et al Has nothing to do with my report Dr Short is a national treasure We are lucky as hell to have him What a useless board iv and yahoo have degenerated into Only a handful and people that post any value Typical of all boards ok done with that LOL GL
