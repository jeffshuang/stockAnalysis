FullSpectrumChicago,True,2019-05-24 10:34:00,1.54,SNES Good morning A friend called me yesterday afternoon wanting to know about this rat fertility biz Hes been in salesretail for 25 years I gave him all the strong points many and weak points very few and fleeting tbh and he could see how it was a winner either way if the Co makes their money on their own or if there is a buyout Hell be buying shares soon He mentioned hearing about the rodent problem since 2017 and that its been on the news this whole week And that a warming climate isnt about to help it His words Not mine Me thinks the global and I do mean global coverage across the board and across multiple levelstiers is just the right strong platform for the next big bounce a different sort of support So Im holding strong Been here and have done this before I know what I hold Do your DD and make sure you do too Best of luck to everyone May we all prosper
rumbear,True,2019-05-24 10:32:00,1.54,SNES I take a lot of flack for being hyper critical of this company I own a ton of shares believe in the product and believe its our duty to hold the company accountable Not releasing news of some kind before a long weekend is an amateur move SenesTech needs to consistently release news and remind shareholders and the market they are working for them I totally expect and understand any criticism for my opinion Still bullish
