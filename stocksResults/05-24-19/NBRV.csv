galaberge,True,2019-05-24 15:27:00,2.37,NBRV Food for thoughts Patents A patent is a property right issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO to an inventor to EXCLUDE others from making using offering for sale or selling the invention throughout the United States or importing the invention into the United States for a limited time in exchange for public disclosure of the invention when the patent is granted Generally the term of a new patent is 20 YEARS from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States A company may apply for a patent from the USPTO anywhere along the development lifeline of a drug and can encompass a wide range of claims However many other factors can affect the duration of a patent A nobrainer
