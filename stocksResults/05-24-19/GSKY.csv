Footballkid9686,,2019-05-24 15:42:00,10.903,GSKY As long as we keep pushing sideways we should eventually break the downtrend Thats a big if though
Footballkid9686,,2019-05-24 15:39:00,10.895,GSKY 360k shares sold from our friend at Cantor today
Tallywag,,2019-05-24 15:18:00,11.015,GSKY wow some buys for once
Footballkid9686,,2019-05-24 13:58:00,10.875,GSKY Theyre hitting the buy backs so hard that the stock doesnt show any signs of breaking its lowvolume downtrend on the 5 minute chart
Footballkid9686,,2019-05-24 13:08:00,10.96,GSKY Still tracking the downtrend line
Nickdaytrader,True,2019-05-24 11:41:00,11.025,GSKY Yeah GSKY looks to have a good Bullish Diveregence trend in their 6month chart and their short term charts Once their Stollastic oscillators reach oversold and turn into an uptrend on their 30min chart I will be buying in and waiting for the uptrend to take over Tuesday
Footballkid9686,,2019-05-24 10:47:00,10.995,GSKY The seller at CF is still active theyre the morons who dropped a block of shares to stop us from breaking out Theyve sold about 200k shares so far today
Nickdaytrader,True,2019-05-24 10:09:00,11.171,GSKY Looks like GSKY is setting up for a Bullish Divergence pattern from their recent sell off Im gonna look for a good entry point and buy in and hold until Tuesday Plus GSKY looks to be at a long term resistance too Anybody have anything else to add Any new catalysts or something I am missing
Footballkid9686,,2019-05-24 09:33:00,11.02,GSKY i appreciate the CEO coming out and defending the stock but what I really want is for the board to expand the repurchase authorization
