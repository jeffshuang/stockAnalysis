jsoltys,True,2019-05-24 14:23:00,1.684,BTE added more today Positive news with bitumen restriction being turned down Just need a final verdict on TMX in July The funny thing is this stock is weighed heavily for Canadian exposure but half the assets are US based and only about 10 rely on WCS pricing I see another strong quarter with big debt repayment coming Especially with average price of oil this quarter being higher than last fingers crossed it stays at around 60 or higher for remainder of quarter they should be able to post stellar results
