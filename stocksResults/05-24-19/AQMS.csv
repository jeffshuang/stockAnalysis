giuseppeventuri,True,2019-05-24 13:20:00,1.9,AQMS Post 3 From the audio of last conference we must retain also 2 important points a with ph2 completed 95 achieved next to 100 were as competitive as smelters even considering running costs not mentioning environmental considerations b management is not fun of dilution they count to pay Veolia on cash next year Evidently this will be possible shares then will count much than cash
giuseppeventuri,True,2019-05-24 13:18:00,1.9,AQMS From precedent Post1 Post 2 Sure were at the moment at neutral or little profit in running mods otherwise no mods extension as clearly declared many times by CEO If we stay at this current picture the extension to 16 mods is of course plant cash neutral Actually CEO was prudent he spoke relying on what already obtained But were recovering 70 electrolyte its lead And the goal is to recover 95 phase 2 With ph2 completed well be sure in profit we know Veolia counts on it 70 breakeven vs 95 phase 2 its 25 gain Metric promise delivered Could someone reasonably doubt that phase 2 would not obtained after all the road made Its nothing of trascendent and Veolia will take care of it Recent audio conference seems to me confirming the picture Im giving here Post 3Show More
giuseppeventuri,True,2019-05-24 13:16:00,1.905,AQMS Post 1 Market made a fatal judgment error after unexpected offering it hasnt yet realized companys promises are truly becoming real that now its only matter of months for real Lets make a point In my old blog article seekingalphacominstablog from what was at the time current CC I assumed 12modsfull capacitybreakeven So with 16mods we would had 25 margin gain we could had assumed a quite reasonable 5 gain for licensing 15th of margin for the licensee the rest for licenser From that from market LAB dimension a reasonable market penetration one could easily deduce that AQMS is sure a multibagger investment many many times the current capitalization in matter of 1 or 2 years Now company made an unexpected offering CEO said in last CC that at 16mods the plant would be cash neutral So market scared what is happen Offering unexpected Will process be even profitable 12 or 16 mods for breakeven Bad management Lets reasonPost 2Show More

TTigger,True,2019-05-24 12:15:00,1.942,AQMS Key points heard during qa session yesterday CFO said breakeven is forecast with 16 modules running each module will produce 24 metric tons of lead per day forecasting 11 million salesqtr with 16 modules running no revenue forecast for Clarios in 2019 but it in 2020 CEO said Clarios deal is dependent on 16 modules running producing 25 metric tons of lead per day and meeting environmental emissions criteria Expect to get to 32 modules in 2020 and be able to pay Clarios in cash vs stock at that point
