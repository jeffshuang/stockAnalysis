svertical1,,2019-05-24 11:41:00,4.549,WATT Says T1 partnerproprietarycant talk about other than agreement in place Well if youve been fd by them you better start talking Since no mention of delay I assume its dead So GTAT thesis still strong Says Regulatory approval has been stumbling block companies need global approval BS Japan China Korea still problem so companies will launch regionally Who thinks this way Rizz BELITTLES THEIR PROGRESS OF APPROVAL IN 111 countries Launches in US EU Canada and others are multiple national launches Theres no such thing as a Global launch iPhones Tesla GPS etcwhat Rizz thinks they all landed in every country in the world with the one global language commercial at the same timeomg 36M in cash but reducing spend 9ISH to 85 wowgreat job So best Bull Case 10 million devices takes them to break even This is a big deal if they can get act together
svertical1,,2019-05-24 11:36:00,4.55,WATT Rizz talks about go to market strategies with contact based charging oh welldistance likely not this year no HIT Then stop talking about on wrist or in ear charging Aim for on desk or on tableas shown in WATT video Thats the game changer If WATT want Asians to NEVER approve distance chargingthan keep talking about charging the device in the ear unless you have time for decades long safety studies This is not rocket sciencebe smart
svertical1,,2019-05-24 11:35:00,4.576,WATT Worth listening to FBR Institutional Call if you missed it httpwwwwswcomwebcastbrileyfbr3wattindexaspxn Overall call was good less hype more substance My main beef with strategy Since WATT is only co with FCC Part 18 Approval for Distance Chargingthere should be sprint to get Distance Transmitter ready to go Part 18 Approval is nothing until they have distant product Since receivers work with Contact or Distance transmitter this should be imperative Rizz should not even mention charging hearable in ear A hearablewearable charging on nightstanddesk without need for directional or placement alignment will annihilate current charging methods Distance differentiates go for it with device that needs trickle charge mouse keyboard head phones 1 to 2 feetjust do it
