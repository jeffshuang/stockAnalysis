GoingBrokeNow,,2019-05-24 15:55:00,0.9349,SNSS looks like its going to close towards the bottom of its range today Im still not confident that it has fully shaken everything out yet I predict it will drop further into the 80s Maybe not on Monday Maybe a small bounce for a day or two driven by opportunists but I predict it will continue to fall into the 80s And why shouldnt it All the more chance for the insiders to make even more money off of it when it doubles in price again up from these recent lows

flytrader1,,2019-05-24 15:36:00,0.9362,SNSS after doing some more research Im a bit concerned that SNSS wont have mature data on the 200mg cohort to present at EHA the market will be disappointed with the update I still like this long term 6mo though

flytrader1,True,2019-05-24 14:09:00,0.9509,SNSS cant figure out this move today seems like someone is rotating out of SNSS into ARQL Long SNSS think it is completely undervalued They are behind ARQL but will most likely present good numbers in June
