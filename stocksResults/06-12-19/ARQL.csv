BtkInvestor73,True,2019-06-12 11:29:00,6.412,SNSS BREAKOUT ALERT ARQL Were also seeing some pharmacodynamic endpoints both phosphorylated BTK and the chemokine CCL 2 3 and 4 Most importantly were starting to see sigs of activity So in that 50 mg dose cohort which was subtherapeutic in our minds so we didnt have expectations of this But we saw 2 patients who had improvement in symptoms One was an improvement in night sweats and fatigue This was a Waldenstroms patient And then we also had a CLL patient who had improvement in fatigue and other symptoms and some decreased nodes and palpation That was confirmed in a scan so we had stable nodes in some of the patients nodes and some decrease in others So were really excited to be hopefully right on the cusp of that active level Were in the hundreds right now we still think the target level is going to be between 100 and 300 Slots are all allocated and were targeting EHA in June for our update
