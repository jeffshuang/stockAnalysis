valueguy26,True,2019-06-12 12:06:00,1.31,ZKIN Calm down This is how I see it Chances of complete blow up are only if they are botching their numbers I did a lot of digging and have found no evidence of this but you never know If our shares get diluted down to 13 of what they are worth but the company is legit we still at 3 PE for a company growing at 20 on average We will at least get our money back after a rough patch If dilution stays at the same rate they are countering growth so earnings will be around 50c That 2 PE highly unsustainable This option imo is the most probable situation Finally they can stop dilution and our shares will explode northward My value of intrinsic value based one the third option is between 68 long term Time to sit on my ass and wait
