rbpravin,True,2019-06-12 12:24:00,0.9394,PULM Pulmazole Phase 2 and subsequent steps if phase 2 is successful is being guided by a steering committee having experts from both Cipla and Pulmatrix We all are taking our chances as is the case with any clinical stage Biotech but it would be naive to say Cipla did not know what they were getting into and that they will be nastily surprised Indian companies are stingy and rarely spend money unless there is promise and thats why you dont see too many large Indian multinational corporations as Indians risk appetite is too low
BiotechXpert,True,2019-06-12 12:16:00,0.9399,PULM Cipla obviously spent a lot of time on due diligence before inking the deal People selling now are idiots

PULM,,2019-06-12 11:04:00,0.9244,PULM so longs this is what we NEED to see in order to have even a glimmer of hopewe NEED a TEST of those lows that PASSES the test then we NEED to see those lows REJECTED something that has NEVER happened with PULM lets face facts right then we NEED to see SP above 125that all seems like a tall order which is probably why sabby is all over this POS just makes sense kudos to them i suppose

PULM,,2019-06-12 10:56:00,0.9311,PULM so EVEN IF and IF is the key word the science is good lets give it 5050 this will STILL go down to TEST the lows 072082C that were set if you believe the job of the market is to test highs and test lows seeing where the supply and demand is located that is the best case scenario IF the science IS any good itll be a positive test passed if not
