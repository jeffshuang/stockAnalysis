LordWatzmann,,2019-06-12 11:26:00,0.8838,DCIX As annoying as the dilution by a further 9523 million shares 10mio 105 is the calculation remains correct 100 million share capital plus 2 tankers remaining purchase price 53 million 37 million shares plus additional income The latter will accrue to the company from August and increasingly from December
