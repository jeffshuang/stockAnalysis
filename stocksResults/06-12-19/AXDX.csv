EATSMD12,,2019-06-12 15:10:00,20.21,AXDX I had a chance to read the Edmiston article and I still do not have an answer to my question regarding competition and valuation of AXDX The article indicates that there could be a role for AXDX in infection control But if GenMark Luminex and Biofire can detect 95 of pathogens and provide resistance information in 12 hours and it takes AXDX 7 hours then why would you choose AXDX It would present a lab workflow problem in that you can only run 3 patient samples a day on an AXDX machine vs 1520 on GNMK LMNX or BMXBiofire Unless it is AXDXs strategy to be a second line test for the 5 of pathogens that their competition misses if that is the case then I cannot justify a 1B market cap on AXDX It is too expensive Even with an insider backing the stock
FraudBuster,,2019-06-12 13:55:00,20,AXDX Yesterdays near 5 drop was on approx 20 below average volume based on a 20D scale So it was low but not insanely low like today at this time 26K shares traded I almost never say manipulation but this stock for as long as Ive been watching it looks like its often played All we need is a leak true or not that Jack is considering taking it private and the SP would go insane
WhackaMole,True,2019-06-12 13:05:00,20,AXDX All it takes to start a monster short rally is for people to pull their borrows or an investor new or old to start trying to accumulate 1 million shares at these prices My broker did call me before that other recent spike to borrow my shares at 25 I said no thankyou
