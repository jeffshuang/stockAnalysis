caveat_emtor,,2019-06-12 15:56:00,3.525,ADMA Just found this out Biotest engaged Raymond James sell 5813954 ADMA shares The sale was completed on June 6 2019 Well RJ was also involved in the recent offering of ADMA shares at 4 pps which closed on May 21 2019 I expect RJ was well aware of the impending Biotest divesture when they ran the May offering Its clear some tute entity is now gobbling up the shares at below May offering price of 4 Just a matter of time before they take it up again

What_Goes_Up,True,2019-06-12 15:48:00,3.52,ADMA Patience and self control is what you need to make a lot of money here This thing is set up as well as possible for a biotech most major unknowns removed no FDA problems sales imminent and stock temporarily depressed due to no problem of the companys
gknuckles,,2019-06-12 15:36:00,3.535,ADMA The companys story has changed fundamentally in recent months Before May it was a developmental biotech stock with a share price and valuation driven by speculation around binary approval events With the key approvals achieved it is now an execution story The stock may take a while to adjust to this new reality Or will it6 in two weeks
Ronaldo86,True,2019-06-12 15:20:00,3.53,ADMA should be easy for Raymond James to handle buyers and sellers here after their recent involvement with the offering

StockMan112909,,2019-06-12 14:47:00,3.5,ADMA maybe in a couple years well see that this pay off but we got played when we thought it was going to be great after two approvals I still believe in ADMA but the SP doesnt appear to be skyrocketing any time soon necessary struggles for long term success

Zkestner87,,2019-06-12 14:44:00,3.51,ADMA still dont see why people are selling Im guessing impatientience Biotest really scared a lot of weak hands it appears
gknuckles,,2019-06-12 14:41:00,3.505,ADMA Volume seems to have gone back to months ago levelsIs this the calm before the storm Any PR whatsoever and this stock starts to ascend to a more respectable and deserved SP territory I sense we are days away from a steady upward trajectory that will not slow till double digit stock price is made the new normal for ADMA wont be long now
ajax22,True,2019-06-12 14:25:00,3.53,ADMA Bought before FDA and sold after because Ive seen how bios react in that scenario But Ive been buying everything under 4 because this company has a lot of potential Once sales start rolling in this should easily be 8

Ginos2000,,2019-06-12 12:07:00,3.57,ADMA volume seems less than other days Can we assume they either took a day off or finished dumping yesterday
BlueRain,True,2019-06-12 12:04:00,3.58,ADMA Ok everybody Im going to buy 1 share for 10 lets see if it goes thru during normal hours
gknuckles,,2019-06-12 11:58:00,3.565,ADMA NOBODY HAS MADE MONEY ON THIS STOCK EVERYONE JUST KEEPS ACCUMULATING IT BECAUSE THEY SEE THE VALUE LONGTERM ANYONE THAT HAS HELD SINCE PRIOE TO APPROVALS ARE DUE ALOT MORE THAN 6
gknuckles,,2019-06-12 11:49:00,3.555,ADMA THERE IS ONLY UPSIDE HERE ALL RISK OF FDA APPROVAL PROCESS IS BEHIND US YOU COULD RECOMMEND THIS STOCK TO ANYONE IN GOOD FAITH BASED SOLELY ON INVESTMENT FUNDAMENTALS THIS IS NOT A POS STOCK LIKE WE ARE USE TO BUYING AND SELLING OVER AND OVER ALWAYS WITH A HOPEFUL PROMISE OF AN APPROVAL TO COME THIS IS A BIO THAT IN 5 SHORT YEARS ACCOMPLISHED FDA APPROVAL FOR A NEW DRUG CANDIDATE AND MULTIPLE PATENTS FOR HOW THESE DRUGS ARE PRODUCED THEY BOUGHT AND REVAMPED A STATE OF THE ART FACILITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN PRODUCTS THIS SHOULD ALREADY HAVE FLOWN TO AT LEAST 6 THE FACT THAT ITS HOLDING WITH BIOTEST DUMP IS ALL YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND 6 IN TWO WEEKS IS STILL MY STANCE LOOK AT THE OTHER COMPANIES YOU OWN DO THEY COMPARE IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL WAYS OR ARE ALL OTHER BIO STOCKS PURE GAMBLE ON FUTURE APPROVALS FOR POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL DRUGS THIS IS REAL WALLSTREET TIME TO SHOW THE MONEY
Zkestner87,,2019-06-12 11:44:00,3.561,ADMA how long are we going to blame Biotest for this stocks performance If it continues after this week well have to find someone else to blame Ha
Enigmatron,,2019-06-12 11:36:00,3.575,ADMA Swung trade between a couple of candles to pick up a dozen free shares Its nickel and dime shit but doing that several days in a row adds up
Enigmatron,,2019-06-12 11:34:00,3.553,ADMA If we dont see anymore biotech share flushing today the candlesticks show that this could move up a bit

CoolRunnings19,,2019-06-12 11:08:00,3.53,ADMA the dump is coming soon just like everyday its been doing on schedule Any more buyers
BlueRain,True,2019-06-12 11:07:00,3.53,ADMA Seems that HUGE candle from Feb 12 its acting as support at 348Buy in increments in case she breaches it going to be hard to breachunless huge dumping happens
Romanwarrior,,2019-06-12 11:04:00,3.52,ADMA The truth of the matter is that the FDA is the controlling entity of this entity Their directive is for approval only But FDA is the puppet master behind this one That explains a lot of the actionsaction going on and aa lot more coming This is why Managenent is totally hush hush The FDA is using ADMA along with its flagship products a d related patents to integrate with another company I wont say the name to flagship ADMAs products along with otherlabel and mostly off label uses Unfortunately Biotest has to go in the FDA decided fast and now This is all happening because we are at a crisis because of supply of p i v e g type products

lucascrum1,True,2019-06-12 10:24:00,3.509,ADMA I have 20k ready to buy when it dips into the 34 range inevitably today
ReefShark,,2019-06-12 10:21:00,3.508,ADMAbullsonparade91or anyone Was the Biotest agreement with Raymond James to sell at a FLOOR of 375 minus fees or can they release shares lower If it is a floor then we should consider that resistance until shares have been liquidated Thanks
cdm85,,2019-06-12 10:15:00,3.514,ADMA if this truly is an artificial dip because of Biotest getting out selling millions of shares well then it should be one of the best buys you can do Shares will return to normal value when selling os over
