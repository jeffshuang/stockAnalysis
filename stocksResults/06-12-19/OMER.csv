MDRFins,,2019-06-12 13:32:00,16.68,OMER For those claiming GD and team are moving too slowly on Narsoplimab you can probably figure out who Im referring to lets look at the facts rather than lashing out On stem cell TMA the company convinced the FDA to let them convert the phase 2 into a phase 3 trial and to use existing patients without a control group Omeros will be agreeing on end points knowing the vast bulk of the data already This approach has shaved years off what would normally be required As to IgA Omeros has convinced the FDA to provide multiple pathways to accelerated approval and is the only company eligible for full approval based on proteinuria reduction alone By making eGFR a confirmatory endpoint and even that may not be needed the company again cut years off the approval time for the drug Im frustrated by the share price too but claiming the company is moving too slowly on Narsoplimab is just false

gless3940,True,2019-06-12 12:25:00,16.694,OMER Thetoad if you dont have the disposition for this reduce your position or close it I believe in the long run that will cost you a lot of money But by your posts you seem to always want management to do something even though all of us do not have the information or expertise that management has I am impatient also and do not like the stock going down But if investing was easy everyone would be rich But having someone constantly moaning and complaining does not help LONG AND STRONG OMER AND KEEPING NEGATIVE FEELINGS TO MY SELF Patient is a virtue which I believe will be rewarded
