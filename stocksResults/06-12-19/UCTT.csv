Chickenstick1,,2019-06-12 11:51:00,12.614,UCTT is off on LRCX downgrade Evercore analyst sees a 2 quarter shift back in memory tick up citing trade uncertainties Silver lining any weakness may cause the Fed to lower interest rates which could in turn start another buying frenzy Plus all this antitrust rhetoric has got me bullish on OEMs Also if companies like QCOM not a UCT customer and other chip companies alike are forced to renegotiate their royalty structure it can only be a net positive for OEM margins
