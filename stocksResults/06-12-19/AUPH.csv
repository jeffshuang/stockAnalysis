humour,False,2019-06-12 11:16:00,6.165,CTRV This scambag Robert Foster is so predictable After 170 rs releases some BS mouse data hoping for a pump due to low float after pathetic reverse split and then next day files prospectus for equity offering AUPH This is whom ILJIN pushes to auph BOD LolTIP CTRV is one of the best shorts out there

paperjam,,2019-06-12 10:15:00,6.16,AUPH empty slide 26 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS seems like ILJINs on tour Im not dismissing this info but it feels like theres a missing piece somewhere and I think they would have much higher chances going from 1 to 2 seats But its also possible they SIMPLY want a significant sway on board ahead of the strategic decisions this year Anyway I think a longterm effect of all this will be very positive
LordDragon,,2019-06-12 10:15:00,6.16,AUPH I see the circus is in townmany clowns visiting our grounds

IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-06-12 10:07:00,6.135,AUPH So how about this Their Nominees are independent they say right So in one moment they are saying that they dont want to Run the company but their presentation on slide 25 says that if their nominees get voted in they are going to do the following thingsSounds like they are planning on running the company and their nominees already have their marching orders from Iljin right
SkeletorInvestor,,2019-06-12 10:07:00,6.135,AUPH I will buy if it hits 69
IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-06-12 09:58:00,6.14,AUPH Their presentation blows my mind No common share ownership by CEO Of course not dumb asses He was hired the company immediately went into blackout Iljin started fucking around and now they are still in Blackout because of you He couldnt have bought shares if he wanted to

UT_RPh,True,2019-06-12 09:48:00,6.159,AUPH let me see if I have this correct ILJIN says they are the ones who care about shareholders and SP but they cuz discourse and drive SP down 10 I think they are the ones materially and actually bringing the SP down No one else would be dropping 60K shares at a time in low 6s They really know how to treat us to get our support
skiesthelimit64,,2019-06-12 09:46:00,6.173,AUPH Down she comesas usual makes a move and they short the hell out of it
