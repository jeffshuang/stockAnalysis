Pineapple1,True,2019-06-12 10:45:00,3.215,AVXL Another interesting conclusion Conclusion Sig1R agonists have been used in the treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases eg Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases AD and PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Utilization of Sig1R agents early in AD and similar other diseases has remained an overlooked therapeutic opportunity Thank God Anavex didnt overlook it
Pineapple1,True,2019-06-12 10:36:00,3.21,AVXL For those doing their DD on Anavex The company has discovered a drug that treats the root cause of multiple diseases Disease has multiple causes viral bacterial Fungalmold environmental and the one that we have had the hardest time cracking Genetic or misfolded protein Recent discoveries in genetic editing such as CRISPR 8 and 9 have lead to some progress in fixing some familial diseases yet most diseases are syndromes Those having multiple causes not just a genetic component Another drawback to CRISPR is the potential to create cancer by inadvertently triggering the P53 gene which is the on switch for rapid growth of cells eg cancer This is where Anavexs drug 273 is unique The drug stimulates individual cell survival response so that the body uses its natural defense to fix problems related to gene mutation and protein misfolding This is the beginning of the end for many drug companies because once the root cause is found fixed nothing is left Anavex Now
Pineapple1,True,2019-06-12 10:23:00,3.21,AVXL kudos to Kevil33 on Ihub for the link to the Sigma 1 frontiersinorgarticles10 gives you an indepth review of the S1R trends in research a timeline on discovery and brief review of what it does
Pineapple1,True,2019-06-12 10:18:00,3.207,AVXL Reviewing the recent article on Trends in Sigma 1 research in the conclusion and why we find Anavex as the leading and only company perusing this line of research the lack of selective Sigma1 ligands approved for use in humans could be the result of insufficient research effortinterest by the scientific community including biopharmaceutical companies In fact only 247 authors have five or more publications and the growth in the production of articles is not constant over time with periods of stagnation of approximately 5 years The authors appear grouped in relatively independent clusters thus suggesting a low level of collaboration between those devoted to the Sigma1 receptor Furthermore as evidenced by the number of recent articles only one pharmaceutical company developing selective Sigma1 receptor drug ligands is currently actively publishing in the field Thus the companys stealth in developing 273 keeping the competition in the dark until we are ready
