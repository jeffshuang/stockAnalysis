Chark,,2019-06-12 12:15:00,19.179,NVTA Ive turned slightly bullish but this stock has a real problem with the most important feature volume It has none until it does its a lost cause
neil30,True,2019-06-12 11:25:00,19.251,NVTA Im curious what others on this board think Giving away free testing in my opinion does not mean NVTA gets no revenue but that the customer gets tested for free That does not mean NVTA is doing the test free Perhaps whoever Nvta is partnering with is footing a discounted cost of the test My opinion NVTA has to be making something off these partnerships Any reasonable responses or comments appreciated
Listener2307,True,2019-06-12 10:55:00,19.336,NVTA The programs referenced by other posters are important At first it is easy to dismiss such give away programs But these diseases are hereditary That means family members should be tested and monitored for generations to come So Person A will lead NVTA to person B C and D And Doctor A who has acquired a long term patient he can actually help will refer patient 123 for testing And patient 1 2 3 will want their relatives tested and so forth So you and I may never have heard of these eye diseases and digestive diseases but they help our company grow FWIW This is exactly how Microsoft got its big break they provided Windows to the governement at no charge
DomLuminous,True,2019-06-12 10:36:00,19.12,NVTA the data here is what is valuable Not the cost of the test
