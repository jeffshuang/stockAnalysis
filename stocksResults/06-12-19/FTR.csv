Nab_Investments,,2019-06-12 15:32:00,1.484,FTR Part 3 Why is this possible well institutions are not interested in selling low as they are trapped at a very high price before split and even after averaging down Less and less of FTRs stock will be left to be traded You have been warned
Nab_Investments,,2019-06-12 15:32:00,1.484,FTR Part 2 The institutions will create a strangle hold on the share volumesupply the maths for this is complex but its nearly there now as this is one of my strategies and once it happens even I cant tell you where the price will end up I have never imagined in my widest dreams that a scenario where 90 or more of FTR stock can be held by institutions and have the possibility of 60 of that sock lent out to shorts For me its a dream of a trade I cant be the only person seeing this This means that if there is ever a short cover first to the door exit apx 10 of free floating stock which can be sold profitably would be bidded by apx 60 of borrowed institutional stock Those that want to exit the short trade I agree not everybody will look for an exit but as the share price rockets and margins come into play forced liquidations will be envitable
Nab_Investments,,2019-06-12 15:31:00,1.49,FTR Part 1 I have had a lot of messages asking my opinion My opinion is I would like to see apx 20m shares traded at around 150 This for me will become the turning point as FTRs saviour is none of us well I am a substantial investor but I still exclude myself The saviours are the institutions who are averaging down If I see their holding coming up to greater than 90 as at todays price the temptation is to great not to accumulate and average further down BK is not in sight only maybe for the foolish I am not saying BK is not impossible but not this year or 202122
