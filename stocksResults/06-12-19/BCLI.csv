1philosopher,,2019-06-12 14:58:00,3.6,BCLI Streaming news event on No More Excuses FDA and ALSA Protest on FB Ask to be addedthey will approve you All footage will be saved
Market_Max,,2019-06-12 14:55:00,3.6,BCLI What we need is actually not the coverage on the protest What we need is a PR from BCLIs management on any concessions won with the FDA that will speed up the approval of NurOwn Thats what will move the SP For example the FDA were the ones to invite Mitsubishi Tanabe to submit an NDA for approval of Radicava Thats the kind of concession we need to hear about THEREs ABSOLUTELY NO REASON NUROWN SHOUDNT BE GIVEN ACCELERATED APPROVAL BASED ON THAT P2 DATA
