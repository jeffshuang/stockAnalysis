quickdraw00,True,2019-06-12 15:29:00,1.567,CIFS Good luck getting any big lots of shares No one is selling them
investor7,False,2019-06-12 13:06:00,1.67,CIFS Good short if it gets back to 173 174 as that is the new resistance Three months ago when this was 390 I hesitated to pay the 47 interest rate to short this baby Working out well at this time 173 174 is another big opportunity if it gets back up there
