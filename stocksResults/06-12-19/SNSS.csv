Eddie2018,,2019-06-12 10:47:00,0.6317,SNSS Market manipulators drive this down the expectation is No robust response at this level It is likely to be true On the other hand will No robust response at 100mg fail this drug As both GDC0853 and ARQL drug show that needs to escalate to very high dosage level to show robust response

Eddie2018,,2019-06-12 10:32:00,0.6245,SNSS ARQL has confirmed a dose dependent clinical activity for their BTK inhibitor It is likely to be true for SNSS Keep in mind 100mg is just at starting point they can escalate to 500mg At this level no one expecting a Robust response but any efficacy signal tumor reduction is good news
