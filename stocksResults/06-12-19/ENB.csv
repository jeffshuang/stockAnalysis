SwingTradeToronto,,2019-06-12 11:30:00,34.435,ENB ENBCA When I am confused and not sure what to do I look at the technicals on a weekly 5 year chart This puts the bigger picture in perspective This chart shows me that ENB has more room to fall Note that RSI is still in the 40s MACD is just crossing over to downward direction and STO is not yet at the 20 mark This analysis is never perfect and theres no guarantee it will keep going lower but this tells me that it is possible
