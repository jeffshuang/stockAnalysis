UncleRicoQB1,,2019-06-12 15:49:00,3.01,VLRX With the extremely low outstanding shares 531M and float 327M Im surprised none of the penny stock newsletters have done a promotion to run the share price
Mikeyjiang,,2019-06-12 15:37:00,3.012,VLRX She is fun get everybody thinking
UncleRicoQB1,,2019-06-12 15:33:00,2.995,VLRX iwanderer I believe VLRX already tapped into the ATM offering just a few weeks ago and is done raising capital for the next 6 months Look at the volume on May 22 it was 601M The current outstanding shares is 531M IMO that was an ATM offering If not Im open to a better explanation

iwanderer,False,2019-06-12 12:07:00,3.034,VLRX UncleRicoQB1 VLRX tried to make ATM offer back in March after the 2018 Q4 ER with the offering price of 76 38 B RS share and no one was buying it So the offer was not executed See their Prospectus filing secgovArchivesedgardata Im quite sure VLRX will make another ATM attempt SOON They incompetently drive the company cash value from 14MIL on 12312018 to a PATHETIC 14Mil on 3312019 They BURN like theres no tomorrow Ill wait for Q2 ER or after ATM offer to buy back in Total MC 16MIL is RIDICULOUSLY HIGH with the real cash value of just 14Mil and 49MIL long term debt
UncleRicoQB1,,2019-06-12 11:29:00,3.033,VLRX Total market cap 16M which is downright silly Its the same situation as TNDM about 18 months ago At this share price the market is ASSUMING another secondary offering soon I dont think that happens based on the CEOs comments in last weeks press release The Company now expects to end the second quarter with 27 million in cash and cash equivalents vs the original estimate of 25 million with the Companys current cash position now allowing it to operate into February 2020 assuming no additional capital or nondilutive financing
