AdamAlpha,,2019-06-12 11:04:00,40.663,SPY this is why I believe the US economy hasnt reacted to world events essentially we have not seen the sharp spike in money supply that would lead to market over leverage in the public sector or big inflation We would see a spike if the fed were to cut rates which would be a horrible mistake that could end the US cycle early following a possible sugar rush Long story short I called the Q4 correction on the back of my main indicator XHB but I stopped shorting months ago And why would I attack spy when theres FXI and SMH China deleverage May cause a huge volatility spike but unless a black swan comes a dip might just be a dip not the end
