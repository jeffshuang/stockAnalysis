Scargs,,2019-06-12 10:34:00,1.28,LMFA 5 weeks ago I emailed LMFA asking when the twice cancelled shareholders meeting would be held I got a swift reply saying the date would be announced in the near future I emailed them again earlier today to enquire once again about the proposed meeting I got a very brusque reply stating there was no date set as yetWhat they should have said was When Craven have finished hoovering up shares on the cheap they will then announce a date so they can get over the 50 for control by buying the rest needed
