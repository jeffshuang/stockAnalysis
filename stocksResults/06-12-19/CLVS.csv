rimbaud,,2019-06-12 15:20:00,13.105,CLVS The most puzzling thing with this company is why the Board has allowed Mahaffy to stay on He was caught by SEC falsifying trial results cost the company and shareholders big money in fines Supposedly he had buyout offers awhile back turned them away only to see company value crumble and has been in charge as the share value has been totally decimated Why in the world would they be letting him remain in his position Somewhere buried in the answer to that is the answer to whether you should just take your loss on this and call it a day
