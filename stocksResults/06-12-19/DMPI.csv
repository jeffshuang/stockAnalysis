Michael_Hunt,True,2019-06-12 09:36:00,1.791,CLBS presents one of the most compelling bio opportunities Ive seen I will continue to load sub 3 On the bid now at 285 Accumulating Different type of play than the fast money doubles Ive given you of late in RWLK BLIN DMPI and CTRV but a tremendous play both technically and fundamentally Much higher prices coming on CLBS in 2019 IMHO Loading sub 3
