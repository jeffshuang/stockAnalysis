bmajor,True,2019-06-12 12:08:00,1.1,SCYX I have had somewhat of a philosophical shift in my investing approach It works so much better for me to breathe some space into my trades Im leaning back rather than pushing forward That patience and calming of impulsivity has made a HUGE difference Im not trying to force trades and Im avoiding a tendency to over trade Stepping back and looking at the bigger picture has really changed my perception Take all of the pressure off your shoulders because its clouding your judgement and forcing your hand if you are wired like I am Now Im actually making some money When Im not profiting its all part of a bigger play rather than a panic I wish someone had told me this months ago when I started and I was frenetically forcing bad trades Nothing says it has to happen right this second Slow down and bring some mindfulness into the game This is a reminder for ME above all else
gregt8262,,2019-06-12 11:38:00,1.1,SCYX I find myself lately working my ass off day trading other stocks just to offset the regular daily bleed I get from this stock and bring my overall account balance back to square one
