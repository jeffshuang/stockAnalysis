Greendayplease,True,2019-06-12 10:32:00,29.1,Do people really believe that the elite insurance companies of our country Nationwide and Chubb amongst many many others would partner with a company that is committing fraud No of course not First it was lawsuits for shareholders that went no where now this On an issue in which HIIQ has already been cleared More smoke and mirrors Unreal
AAAlight,True,2019-06-12 10:32:00,29.1,HIIQ The short thesis that a multistate lawsuit for being a boiler room scam would cost the company 100m was settled for 34m without any admission of guilt releases HIIQ from all claims demands interest penalties actions or causes of action See secgovArchivesedgardata
