SpaceGuy65,True,2019-06-12 13:25:00,5.909,MAXR I really wish the shorts would move elsewhere and let this company breatheI guess the good news work to prop the stock up the current market cap makes it easily manipulated down by the shorts and its easy money if you have the means to push it down Do that daily repeatIt is a shame because it affects companies negatively for no reason other than it being a game in which big money can be made by a few players at the expense of growth and long term strategyThere are ZERO reasons at this point to hold this down other than making easy moneyIm not against shorts as a rule They can be a useful part of the market Im glad for the Spruce Point campaign last year for example as it got rid of bad management which was a great thing But this manipulation is almost criminal
