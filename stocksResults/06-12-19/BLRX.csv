jsp4423,True,2019-06-12 15:42:00,0.3356,BLRX who is scared of rs Not me Check out HEB 1 is well Capitalized so no dilution 2 Many catalysts ahead 3 Partnership with big companies Even if they do rs I am not expecting it to drop much I think it will run big after rs They will choose date near big news for big pop after rs as they have many catalysts in 2nd half And like I said before they dont need funds so no worries abt dilution after rs

cubfan22,,2019-06-12 10:06:00,0.33,BLRX Looking back over the past few months of trading this seems to be artificially suppressed Once the sp drops below the next cent increment someone sets up a wall at the top of the cent Todays wall seems to be at 33 Its like walking through a door and locking it behind you The question is Why is this being done

AOT,,2019-06-12 09:40:00,0.3299,BLRX not sure how one can be bullish here Its not showing any signs of strength the opposite actually My fear is these catalysts get pushed further back as they have before which will lead to needing more At these all time lows you would think the would instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano a little humor needed I appreciate the faith and hope but those are terrible recipes for a stock Id be very cautious investing here until it settles
