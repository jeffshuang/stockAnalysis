forsure,,2019-06-12 13:01:00,1.79,IDEX yahoo finance postOnce the quarterly reports are published I believe we will know a lot more about the status of the transactions that were signed and when we will begin to see revenues and profitsAll the indications indicate that revenue from electric bus transactions began in the third quarterOnce this potential becomes real revenue and profits from electric bus transactions will begin to flow and they will expand operations to other markets in Asia and the market will understand that there is a longterm business strategyAnd once the deal with gt dollar becomes real the tokens they get will become cash after they convert the bitcoin And the monthly rewards worth about 3 billion at an annual rate will now begin to enter the balanceThe market will evaluate ideanomics in a completely different wayIn my personal opinion would and these transactions will be realized in the next few years ideanomics will be worth at least 10 billion dollars

StockSquirrel,True,2019-06-12 12:09:00,1.818,IDEX I would assume that those that make decisions on adding and removing companies from the Russel do their own due diligence otherwise their credibility would be questionable I also think that the ER on Aug 12th will be key I guess we will see who is right I appreciate the bearish input and dont block you guys just dont agree I even enjoy the cat vids GLTA

merchvent,,2019-06-12 11:53:00,1.79,IDEX All this Co is is a guy in an NYC office suit churning out MoUs to give the insiders holding 20000 shares a dime pop to scalpNONE of these 50 deals the past year will ever amount to anything in the way of a real cash register They only pile on losses from the travel expenses and convention costs

Techboi,,2019-06-12 10:45:00,1.791,IDEX I really do feel for the bag holders here as they get disappointing and happy in such short time but end up disappointed most of the time the way this company stock moves The pumps are just that and eventually always come crashing down and what bugs me is that many long term bulls load at the top of these pumps instead of buying at its lowest when the price is at historical low levels like 13x and if that breaks usually mid 11x so my advice if youre long dont buy the pops to average down buy when you less want to the most Either way low volume days seems to be starting again
