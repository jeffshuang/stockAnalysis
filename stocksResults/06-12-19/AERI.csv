GlcMD,,2019-06-12 13:38:00,32.71,AERI just cant believe AERI has fallen this low I held AERI from 810 back in 2015 and sold all of it 4850 in late 2017 I thought AERI would surely be in the 80100 range by now after RhopressaRocklatan but I guess market is valuations AERI much differently At least it gets more enticing for favorable buyout offer Long term I still see tremendous valueupside if one can be patient
