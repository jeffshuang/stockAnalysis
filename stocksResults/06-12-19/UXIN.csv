Cory1978,True,2019-06-12 15:13:00,1.971,UXIN Ok just have to make a statement here If you are new and confused on this stock dont feel overwhelmed I will help straighten you out but please do your own follow up DD on what I sayUXIN is doing a fantastic job in China Huge growth rates and next ER may very well be profitable even with their new partnership It may not as well as they have taken on an additional debt of 70 million and paid off 180 million dollar loan from the 250 million dollar partnership That said All forecasts are for additional growth and revenue even with the downturn in the Chinese economy The reason it is so cheap is because of strategic short selling by a bigtime company called JCap aka to be referred to as JCrap from here on outJCrap is notorious for playing the short and distort game and they do it wellMany bears on this site actually work for them
Portuga,False,2019-06-12 13:23:00,1.97,UXIN Disloyal people said that UXIN is solid but I tell you UXIN is like a butter in the oven on 2000F What kind does company need 250 million more after 1 year of IPO to cover the costs run away this fake company
