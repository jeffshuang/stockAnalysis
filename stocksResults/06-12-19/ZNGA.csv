DetroitDaveOptionsPlayer,True,2019-06-12 14:27:00,6.182,ZNGA looks like a darn good trend line up to me Higher highs lower lows bounced 2x off of 6 I expect this to run into earnings eclipsing 650 make a nice run to 7 That MAY huge up volume spike is the earlier indicators that another move is coming It went from 550 to 630 made its way up to 650 before retreating Next resistance is 650 a close over that is bullish for the next leg up GLTA

Italianprince,True,2019-06-12 11:41:00,6.195,ZNGA I do not expect Zynga to be at 8 in 90 days I expect Zynga to be in double digits by year end This initial public offering will be a big win for Zynga Does stock options kill a company when granted to the executive board at 0 The public offering has a couple of components1 Has to measure current price No one will buy at 10 a share2 It has to be attractive to the institution and to the company3 These are unsecured and every public ally traded company has risk involved4 Panic will create a sell off and dilute the stock5 Short sellers are now trapped and need their cashI have invested in great companies and sold to early I am willing to loose my shirt on zynga which I know will make me money At 220 everyone was saying Busy At 620 people are saying bust I will stay where my head tells me to

Italianprince,True,2019-06-12 11:15:00,6.205,ZNGA This is not a sell off People are buying the company Please read the opportunity These shares will be exercisable at 831 No one would buy the private offering This should tell you that these institutions have a great opportunity and that Zynga will bust forward The company is not hurting The fundamentals are strong and the restructuring is complete We are going into serious growth mode Remember this offering closes on June 14 Panic is in the head of a retail investor
