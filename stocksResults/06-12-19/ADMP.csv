BowenHardcase,,2019-06-12 09:44:00,1.489,ADMP the big fish shorts could give up on this at any point and push this to mid 2s just getting out but every time I believe its possible that theyll move on theyve literally doubled down and pushed harder smothering SP and cleaning up in process Despite all the potential here Carlo has a cash problem and Sandoz has really dropped the ball on Symjepi launch That along with Zimhi lawsuit which IS a big deal until its dismissed no matter what the armchair lawyer pumpers say about it puts more pressure on SP Not to mention at these levels the growing threat of more dilution to keep lights on or RS to keep listed all puts more pressure on SP and could stifle any runs or even completely offset good news So theres still a lot in play here for short positions and I cant see them abandoning ADMP en masse without tangible cause This thing needs big launch of Symjepi with viral levels of PR and fanfare AND Zimhi approval or cash upfront deal to truly turn the tide
