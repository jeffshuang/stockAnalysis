Nelsin,True,2019-06-12 10:40:00,11.494,VG Im still looking for a move up but that gap down below 1115 could really dip hard if the market doesnt do well in the next few daysHowever my gut tells me someone covered their short this morning Which was done premarket by professionals Hence why the price is trying to find its legsHolding to 1115 then Ill have to let it stop out while that gap fills
