LoyalShark,,2019-06-13 09:37:00,1.352,CIDM Anything from this level is a steal If the Future Today deal doesnt happen at this level they would be trading under 1x sales with 63ct share of cash Crazy If the deal goes through they effectively double the size of their OTT to the 60 mil a yr range and note they have other businesses outside of OTT that no one talks about and assume a growth rate of over 50 Remember most of their debt is non Recourse debt Bison owns 23 of stock and has DEEP pockets I wouldnt be betting against CIDM
