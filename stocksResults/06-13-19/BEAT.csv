Listener2307,True,2019-06-13 11:05:00,50.125,BEAT Still holding the position I took in 2016 17 Im happy enough since I almost never trade but I wish I had spotted it sooner when it was 5 in 2013 The only stocks I hold are BEAT and NVTA I got NVTA a lot earlier on the curve than BEAT so I hope to make 10X my investment there

InvestMKE,True,2019-06-13 09:36:00,50.187,Keep an eye on BEAT here could be moving higher after a nearly 3 month long sell off with UNH CNC ISRG and other healthcare related stocks We continue to array positions in both BEAT and CNC
