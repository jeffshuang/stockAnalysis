ecoethcon,,2019-06-13 13:56:00,1.668,CPAH Here is the near term catalyst barronscomarticlesthesl Basically if Slack is priced at about 10B based on its revenues it is not yet profitable and may take longer to get there than CPAH that would value CPAH at around 200M which would be ABOUT33share In many ways CPAH is more diversified and faces less stiff competition in its core business If CAPH can show continued increase in the recurring revenue numbers on its way to cash flow break even in 2020 then we could easily see those numbers and even higher ones
HubertGRection,True,2019-06-13 13:54:00,1.653,Slingshot CPAH owns your assyou got schooled son

Michael_Hunt,True,2019-06-13 10:07:00,1.626,Dont be surprised to see a halt on CPAH today this volume this early is a huge indicator This can be a supernova Look at who this company is affiliated with check their float and their price history 300 spikes are a quarterly tradition on this name HON UBER CRM all partners here wake up

Lexro,True,2019-06-13 09:49:00,1.49,CPAH Come on wake up its time to go to the moooon
Michael_Hunt,True,2019-06-13 09:48:00,1.49,CPAH excellent find by simbatrading on twitter the PR that HON put out this morning ties back to the presentation with CPAH a few weeks back httpstwittercomsimbatradingstatus1139166746919809024 People are massively sleeping on this hidden gem Sitting at chart bottom no volume Thats when its time to load It requires some patience but make no mistake at some point the volume will come either from news or out of nowhere This will be my biggest gainer in 2019 I think
