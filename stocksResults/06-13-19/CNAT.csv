msmall0,True,2019-06-13 11:34:00,0.7453,CNAT Might have something here
LAKEMARY,True,2019-06-13 10:43:00,0.7495,CNAT you could conceivably have LF miss and Novartis initiates combo therapy and we have a 15 to 20 stock IMO
LAKEMARY,True,2019-06-13 10:39:00,0.7495,CNAT Novartis stated from the start that they are interested in combo therapy with their FXR drug doesnt have to be approved as a single agent for Novartis to initiate combo therapy Also can be FDA approved as part of a combo Doesnt have to be a first line therapy to be approved
