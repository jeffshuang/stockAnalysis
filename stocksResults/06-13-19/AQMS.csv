fergy,,2019-06-13 12:38:00,1.56,AQMS Veolia is smart They put there employees on the site for training Incase this works out So when they decide to build a plant they can operate it themselves If it doesnt they can get rid of the employees You cant get rid of a plant once its built unless you take a huge loss
