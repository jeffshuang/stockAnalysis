Cool77,True,2019-06-13 13:45:00,6.588,CBAY Correct me if Im wrong but I guess most people with Nash problems have ended up that way by being a little over indulgent with less than healthy foods and sweet stuff not judging which are really addictive Coupled perhaps with insufficient exercise Surely unless patients beat their addiction to junk food and make extreme effort to improve their life style no medication could ever on its own reduce liver fat could it

juneleeyo,True,2019-06-13 13:10:00,6.78,CBAY FDA is concerned that some pts with severe fat reduction do not get better but get worse with faster onset of cirrhosis The liver fat is only one of several things leading to oxidative stress the key mechanism in NASH Liver fat alone is not enough for development of NASH There was a plenty of diets drugs diabetes cholesterol meds already out in the market that showed more than 30 liver far reduction but all failed eventually We need a medicine that block the downstream pathway of this phenomena of central oxidative stress and fibrogenesis CBAYs NASH p2b data showed remarkable liver enzyme and biomarker reductions I think these positive findings are real as pvalue was so so low And the data virtually derisk the upcoming PBC p3 data as NASH p2b used so much higher doses if Seladelpar If this positive trends continues I believe there is a fair chance that it would resolve central oxidative stress as well as reversing NASH and fibrogenesis
