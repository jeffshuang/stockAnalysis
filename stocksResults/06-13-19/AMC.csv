wbwang1217,,2019-06-13 10:57:00,10.707,AMC From the box office data I see both April and May beat the months in 2018 2018 has a record high June with 127 B but June of 2019 started very well I guess its only because people are worring that this June cannot beat last June But Aladdin and the Private life of Pets 2 are doing well so far We also have several new films in the coming two weeks and Toy Story 4 will be fantastic
