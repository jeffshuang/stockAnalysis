cooter1x,True,2019-06-13 10:00:00,0.8033,CPST Nice FPP order of 32MW today Just remember there are still parts defects which started in Q1 2019 from a discontinued supplier that cost us 55M all fiscal 2019 Still some are being fixed today Also a big note to understand is Adj EBITDA FY2019 was a 116M loss FY2018 only a 52M loss DJ should sue that supplier Also note that GESS future sale of 96MW for 13M was for TWELVE C1000S high end turbines Why shouldnt that be a 12MW sale instead of only 96 Also FYI DJ states it cost approx 750K to make a c1000s used in rental program Hope he uses refurbished turbines for those purposes So much spin on these numbers I still cant understand Here is a good recap on Q4 year end 2019 Read carefully please seekingalphacompr1754152
