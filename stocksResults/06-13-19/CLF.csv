ironwillgal,,2019-06-13 12:56:00,9.825,CLF Been trying to research costs to GS for bond transfers Will we take hit Q2 or is it amortized Perhaps it isnt an issue for ER at all
beekers,,2019-06-13 12:46:00,9.833,CLF What I dont realize is why dont the Analyst lower their PTs to 910 if the stock lingers in this range for over 2 quarters Clearly the market thinks the stock is at this value So why dont the analysts lower accordingly
Golferbob,,2019-06-13 12:27:00,9.815,X AKS CLF Ok finally getting into the meat of things On cue Time to move even higher

D2S8,,2019-06-13 11:50:00,9.807,CLF oknow to watch it pinned here for a moment then back downthe way of this recently Hanging on anyway
Mg900,,2019-06-13 11:40:00,9.805,CLF Not one bullish analyst raising forecasts as io rises They all forecast it to be at 60 per ton next year These guys are a joke 180 per ton has a better chance than 60
Mg900,,2019-06-13 11:37:00,9.786,CLF On iron ore forecastsee previous post
Mg900,,2019-06-13 11:36:00,9.781,CLF Not one analyst with a price target higher than it is right now For that matter they are all way below the current price The analyst expectations are at the worst possible outcomes for this company SAD

Mg900,,2019-06-13 10:44:00,9.72,CLF I would hate to be a short seller on the dalian who does not have the product for delivery Steel producers know that the shortage is going to get worse Big up moves when they have to cover OH BOY
Mg900,,2019-06-13 10:42:00,9.726,CLF iron ore spiking into the close up 3 to 790
Mg900,,2019-06-13 10:41:00,9.73,CLF I look for CLF to climb to 24 per share in the next 6 months Iron ore will break out to the 150 to 180 range and push EBITDA for this year over 1 billion A normal valuation for a company is 10 times EVEBITDA I will give an 8 times rating 270 million shares plus net debt around 16 billion gets us to 24 per share 2020 could be 125 billion ebitda which at 8 times would give a share price of 3125 This is the deal of the century Dont miss it
D2S8,,2019-06-13 10:25:00,9.745,CLF something really seems to be pinning this below 98not sure he significance of that figure
mnywzrd,,2019-06-13 10:25:00,9.745,CLF what is debt level here i know maturity is 2024 but what is total currently
D2S8,,2019-06-13 10:24:00,9.75,CLF we havent seen 10 in a monthlots of farting around in the 89 area
RagusDogMack,,2019-06-13 10:23:00,9.75,CLF And if you predicted supply disruptions to cause IO to rally 70 since last September and bought CLF you would have been right amazingly and also lost 30 of your money
BobBear,False,2019-06-13 10:21:00,9.705,CLF Ya know its interesting just 2 days ago from 1100 1145 EDT Tue 611 clf fell from 986 to 961 or thereabouts

jrdiggs,,2019-06-13 10:04:00,9.736,CLF Where do you all see CLF trading at by end of year
Mg900,,2019-06-13 09:59:00,9.72,CLF Could be the most undervalued company on the market right now Less than 5 times this years earnings Less then 4 times next years That is based on conservative estimates What if io breaks out We could get 1 billion EBITDA this year
kremun,,2019-06-13 09:51:00,9.76,CLF this is not as volatile as remember building a base
Mg900,,2019-06-13 09:42:00,9.798,CLF Which short will be the smartest and cover now before it is too late
BobBear,False,2019-06-13 09:42:00,9.798,CLF Sorry I guess I should post that on facebook rather then here cause this is an investing site where I should be posting my thoughts about investing in clf
sunnerside,,2019-06-13 09:41:00,9.792,CLF some shrewd investors taking advantage of the IO shortage caused by Vale by investing in Vale 1350 and climbing
