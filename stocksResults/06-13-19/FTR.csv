Nab_Investments,,2019-06-13 15:49:00,1.53,FTR FTR could have a strong Prima Facie case of fraud with regards to Short Distort It would be interesting if institutional lenders had any inclinationknowledge of this and still lent out the shares This could imply that they are also part of the fraud It could be a huge case I am not an expert however the evidence looks really strong The amount of fake and manipulated information I have read about FTR this has to be the first serious test case for a reverse pump and dump
Nab_Investments,,2019-06-13 15:40:00,1.535,FTR I suggest that all concerned parties write directly to the CFO on Linkedin as there could be a very strong prima facie case of serious manipulation of information in the short distort fraud with regards to FTR

Nab_Investments,,2019-06-13 14:39:00,1.519,FTR In my opinion it would be a good idea to get FTRs CEO to open a complaint with the SECFBI to investigate the allegation of persistent and systematic fakemanipulated information with regards to FTR Short Distort like Pump Dump is a serious criminal fraud

Nab_Investments,True,2019-06-13 13:18:00,1.475,FTR I think if the FBI starts an investigation into FTRs false rumours misinformation for the purpose of a Short Distort criminal fraud which is same as a Pump Dump then the best place to start looking is into FTR Seeking Alpha other online commentsarticles I have never read so much BS in my life from supposed experts who state I have no interest in the stock Total BS
