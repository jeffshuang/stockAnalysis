ACBBestofWeed,,2019-06-13 12:27:00,1.65,EYPT A flood of dumb comments hit the board this morning got to block jiffy The stock is fine news was pending and it went up ahead of that news is neutral and the stock is giving back some of those gains Simple
PizzaTime,,2019-06-13 12:20:00,1.66,EYPT Not concerned with losing the 50D holding the orange line is what matters Also the blue line has been the internal TL since 2011 so staying above that is more important than breaking through the far less historically significant yellow resistance line on the first try Hopefully this can breakouthead for 211 gap fill by 625 At the very least stay north of the blue If orange and blue doesnt work out and no PRs 150s40s again
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 12:06:00,1.65,EYPT ER date is just an approximate I dont think theyll do it before September Just like last year And they have had many irregular ER time periods in past So I dont think shes moving an inch unless they announce ER date which I think they never did before 2 weeks of ER So chill We are not going anywhere any time soon I can see 20 downside from here and then it might recover before ER So u have been informed Take it or leave it folks
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 12:02:00,1.64,EYPT i would not care about August ER at this time Its far far away And who knows What if they could not sell enough and dilute sp to raise more money before er Very likely Coz they almost used up all the money from loan So To me it very well positioned to touch 140
Cream4349,True,2019-06-13 11:38:00,1.66,EYPT Wait until after lunch for more positive volume for a close over 170 This will continue bullish trend Otherwise today will be forming a new bottom at 165 either way this thing is going up into August ER
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 11:36:00,1.66,EYPT so insiders bought at 147 but now you are supposed to pay 170 Lol Who does that Theres at least 20 downside from where insiders bought
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 11:33:00,1.67,EYPT stock down And Duediligence20 has a reason to explain why Always how
Trader7981,True,2019-06-13 10:49:00,1.678,EYPT lets see 15s
Cream4349,True,2019-06-13 10:23:00,1.681,EYPT 161 never hit still in at 157
Duediligence20,True,2019-06-13 10:10:00,1.687,EYPT Third candle forming today to confirm reversal and launch this into bull territory
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 09:58:00,1.705,EYPT closing near 152 would be good and reasonable
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 09:56:00,1.7,EYPT I think bottom is at 143 Even company thinks their stock is overvalued Why would anyone pay more than 150
NoGuruHere,,2019-06-13 09:50:00,1.7,OCUL Investors in EYPT should pray their loan from CRG has a better outcome than it did for SGYP I dodged that bullet Holy smokes
Handsome84,True,2019-06-13 09:50:00,1.7,EYPT looks good so far
Cream4349,True,2019-06-13 09:47:00,1.685,EYPT buy now 161 is probably bottom
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 09:46:00,1.7,EYPT nope not looking good Dump it or lose it folks This is not going anywhere Maybe at 140
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 09:39:00,1.7,EYPT on the top bios heading for a nose dive So Very risky Might touch 14 by next week
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 09:38:00,1.68,EYPT Not good news Will give up this weeks gain very easily
Jiffyjiffy,False,2019-06-13 09:37:00,1.692,EYPT will wait for 155 Maybe today or tomorrow Very likely
