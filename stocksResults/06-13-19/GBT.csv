Painful,,2019-06-13 15:39:00,57.08,GBT So much for my EOD uptick prediction
idvst8,True,2019-06-13 15:33:00,57.492,GBT Added This has been consolidating for some time and is a TRUE one Stop Shop for Sickle care moving forward Think SRPT but with a Much Much larger Market With approval and Standard of Care I can make a case for a 18000 pps
jimbarb,,2019-06-13 15:26:00,57.52,GBT We have to consider that a really good result would reduce the chances of competition even from Gene Therapy companies as it is a much more difficult processif it ever works as it is a longer process versus a pill
Painful,,2019-06-13 15:18:00,57.278,GBT Wondering what topics the conference call will cover Assuming the data is good I guess they will give an update on final submissions for the NDA application Also guessing they will update on positions hired for marketing and even for new research Possibly will announce a date to move into their new facilities
Painful,,2019-06-13 15:08:00,57.328,GBT Looking optimistic for that EOD move up but volume is low now so
Painful,,2019-06-13 15:05:00,57.36,GBT A while back I hypothesized that if another company was considering buying GBT out yes here is the buyout topic again they might wait for the rest of the data to be releasedanalyzed

Kunimi_lj,,2019-06-13 12:12:00,57.169,GBT Question no one think GBT will drop tomorrow

RS7788,True,2019-06-13 11:39:00,55.885,GBT Nice Call flow heading into presentation
Painful,,2019-06-13 11:32:00,55.81,GBT Wish we would get closer to 60 prior to tomorrows meeting I hate to see the up move partially absorbed by a low starting price
JoshSadlock,,2019-06-13 11:24:00,55.965,GBT would feel a little better holding this into tomorrows data if it had acted better all week Just gotta bite the bullet at this point
yidarmy,,2019-06-13 10:29:00,54.978,GBT another big call block too carefulcould be a hedge
