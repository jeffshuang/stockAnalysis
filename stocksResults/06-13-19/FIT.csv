proton471,,2019-06-13 12:18:00,4.47,FIT Nice thought Paul Not sure how that would profitable scale given that the fitness center would want a piece of the action plus space rental insurance etc Plus the employees would they be Fitbit employeesWho would managehow Base salary plus commission 100 commission Benefits How much of trackersvc sales are needed to attract train retrain etc the right people And distribution logistics Thats a whole other business that most outsource

paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 11:58:00,4.483,FIT I will close by saying that threelegged stools always fall over if James Park will add this fourth leg to the retail structure he will generate millions of additional sales have highly qualified employees selling his company for him and teaching users all over the world the benefits of Fitbit products
paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 11:57:00,4.481,FIT this type of retail will beat Apple to the punch Apple has their retail centers in town centers all over the world currently they are not going directly to the public with their wearable products If I know Tim Cook he eventually will This idea is blatantly obvious for anyone who has mastered marketing skills
paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 11:56:00,4.49,FIT these young athletic individuals could have magnetic Fitbit logos put on their vehicles and transport these kiosks to different fitness centers in their area possibly two days per week per center The key component is not just showing off the product line but explaining to fitness center users how the smartwatch will benefit their life This is fitbits biggest failure right now
paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 11:54:00,4.486,FIT the kiosks should be manned by Young athletic looking professionals who have been trained by Fitbit as incentivebased entrepreneurial employees The training would be covered by Fitbit but all compensation should be incentive based on sales and finding new locations with the stock being so low its the perfect time to offer stock option based compensation to entrepreneurial employees
paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 11:52:00,4.487,FIT Fitness Centers need recurring revenues just like Fitbit The incentive for them to allow a Fitbit Kiosk would be beneficial as it would bring a national corporation and wellknown brand into their center The display could be similar to those seen in Walmart or Kohls but must be transportable by van or truck
paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 11:51:00,4.481,FIT Fitbits business plan is operating as a threelegged stool The legs are website sales retail sales through stores and insurance sales The fourth leg of sale should be directtoconsumer at fitness centers around the world Let me explain

paulcrandall,,2019-06-13 10:36:00,4.465,FIT This is truly another great commercial from Fitbit Not kidding Has anyone seen it repetitively in their area Why the hell arent they blasting this thing 24 hours a day ispottvadonLlfitbitkno
