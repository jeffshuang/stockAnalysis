t_underbridge,,2019-06-13 15:33:00,62.032,FSLR I think Baird is really underestimating the risk to FSLR from this tariff decision This could significantly undermine the tariffs once manufacturers in SE Asia are able to convert lines to bifacial andor redirect existing bifacial capacity to the US That could crush US ASPs again and hammer future contracts or even put 2020 contracts at risk of cancellation if prices fall enough Its too early to say for sure how this plays out but I think its a bit flippant to simply point to their existing backlog and say there are no problems

alphavertex,True,2019-06-13 11:09:00,61.807,Whats driving company specific returns todayFSLR Following yesterdays 7 pullback in First Solar shares Baird analyst Ben Kallo recommends buying the dip The shares were under pressure yesterday after the US Trade Representative announced bifacial and other specialty solar panels would be exempt from Section 201 solar tariffs This would imply that FSLRs Chinese competitors would not be subject to tariffs However the analyst thinks the fundamental impact of the exemption will be minimal on First Solar given its longterm contracts As such he views the news as largely headline risk and says First Solar remains a top idea
crab22,True,2019-06-13 10:47:00,61.795,FSLR plenty of cash in the bank will keep FSLR able to make the right production choices 17bn available to react to bifacial development imho which is only 3 of mkt so far so plenty of time to address it
WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-06-13 10:41:00,61.508,FSLR SPWR ENPH Very interesting article on the module market and how tight supply is FSLR is sold out into 2021 New factories coming online in the US will help and this is definitely a benefit of the tariffs against Asian and especially Chinese suppliers More factories moving to the US Curious about the giant TSLA factory in Buffalo that Panasonic is a partner in Tesla is not buying enough product so last I heard they were selling some of those modules overseas It all speaks to very strong demand pvmagazineusacom201906
