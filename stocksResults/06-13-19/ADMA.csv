annoyingjoe,True,2019-06-13 11:15:00,3.67,ADMA and so begins the long slog back to normalcy I think
Ronaldo86,True,2019-06-13 11:11:00,3.66,ADMA Think of the price action recently as analogous to a rubber band the biotest selling pressure was significant over the past week shorts attempted to pile on margin calls likely impacted some robin hooders but the SP did not break 350s held surprisingly well Now what happens to a rubber band after all that tension is released it snaps back So far it appears biotest exit has concluded fundamentals price this conservatively in the 4s It will be snapping back quickly They have both approvals facilities license patents and commercialization imminent Gap up will happen sooner rather than later

BlueRain,True,2019-06-13 10:15:00,3.62,ADMA 363 current resistance but very weak should pop to 379 to 381 if buying continues
annoyingjoe,True,2019-06-13 10:01:00,3.602,ADMA I had to block the chimp I wish him well and all but the all caps were distracting and speak to an unstable mind
MSBio,,2019-06-13 09:59:00,3.604,ADMA Even Biotest still has remaining shares considering the percentage it should not matter much when the stock makes the positive turn Whatever I am long for the coming years
