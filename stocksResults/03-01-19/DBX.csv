homer212,,2019-03-01 13:54:00,23.753,DBX Pretty sure sequoia sold dropbox how do they sell 25 of the company so quietly I challenge any of you to find an sec filing on this
kadeerthree,,2019-03-01 13:46:00,23.787,DBX why this trending
blagoje_lukic,True,2019-03-01 13:30:00,23.72,DBX 30s comin
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:18:00,23.761,DBX I will sell my laptop car house and wife if it comes anywhere near 2140 to accumulate more
homer212,,2019-03-01 13:17:00,23.765,DBX does anyone know if sequoia still owns any dropbox if not when they sold Thanks
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:17:00,23.765,DBX put your sell at 2300 if you fear fall to 20
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:17:00,23.765,DBX buying at 2140 will be my double down
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:16:00,23.789,DBX the day dbx fell 10 Ive never seen so many buy ratings hit my phone never had that with squarerokuaphria
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:15:00,23.788,DBX mind you I will be out by 34 but Im telling you its going there
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:15:00,23.788,DBX it will slowly but surely bulldoze its way to 27 30 34 40
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:14:00,23.776,DBX this stallion will not fly like RokuSquareWeed
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:14:00,23.776,DBX but dbx from 24 to 21 would take a hellstorm for dbx to touch 18
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:14:00,23.776,DBX every month there will be the exact same insider selling so dont be foolish
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:13:00,23.752,DBX when Box fell 25 dbx held its ground that alone is huge huge huge signal backs up the 74 institutional ownership
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:13:00,23.752,DBX it will take a Xmas crash to bring DBX back to 1850 it will take shitty damn news to bring her to 21
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:12:00,23.735,DBX Im not a short seller Im not a day trader but looking for the black horse
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:11:00,23.74,DBX the slow bleed pleases me as does the many buy ratings I see on my app from this stock
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:10:00,23.735,DBX Ive bought aphria roku square at bottoms Those were my last 3 hits If you look at my posts I have gone silent on other 3
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:10:00,23.735,DBX I guarantee a run up of 3 minimum in the 14 days prior to the next earnings report That gives you a buffer if it falls to 21
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:09:00,23.738,DBX the fact that there is lowered guidance tells me it will be easier to beat next roundquarter
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:09:00,23.738,DBX Regardless DBX is the only stock I know that exploded with buy Rayo gas after missing guidance
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:08:00,23.738,DBX I see DBX as the black horse that will possibly trickle bleed to 2221
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:07:00,23.738,DBX I see DBX hold its ground
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:07:00,23.738,DBX I see BOX crash 25 after a miss
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:07:00,23.738,DBX I see a ton of institutional ownership
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:06:00,23.735,DBX I saw DBX fall 10 and another 3 Bought a ton at 2340 when I saw a bottom I will buy more if I touches anywhere under 24
BenDover85,,2019-03-01 13:06:00,23.735,DBX Possible cupwithhandle setup if you look at the chart from Nov918 until now Would like to hear some thoughts
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:05:00,23.745,DBX but I watched Dbx explode to 40 last summer on some news saw it fall to 18 on Xmas tariff and Fed issues crash
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:04:00,23.748,DBX I have no bullshit licences or fancy porches and lamborghinis pretending to be Wall Street
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:04:00,23.748,DBX Im not a chart guy but I research and I look at markets and trends
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:04:00,23.748,DBX Roku was destroyed from 77 to 27 and I bought all in around 28 kicking myself when I got all out at 58
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:03:00,23.745,DBX aphria took a huge beating because of a short seller I bought near 5 and sold out at 8 kicking myself now
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:01:00,23.745,DBX I have a story to tell read any of my posts from last summer last Xmas
JediCanada1,,2019-03-01 13:01:00,23.745,DBX
