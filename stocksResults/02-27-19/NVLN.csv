exostrade,True,2019-02-27 13:52:00,1.25,NVLN been holding since 87 its tough you want a day trade but with 88 inst held its a med term hold Recent news was huge
exostrade,True,2019-02-27 13:50:00,1.25,NVLN holding sucks its better under accumulation since you are not losing money Dont want to be that guy who sells then pop guy whole
exostrade,True,2019-02-27 13:48:00,1.259,NVLN accumulation then a bounce Earning in 2 weeks A run up leading to ER and if all goes well potential buyout then this will rocket
DarkSonar,,2019-02-27 11:17:00,1.268,NVLN alright I reached a point where this has to go Almost a month hold and didnt take profit when I had the chance Break even point
