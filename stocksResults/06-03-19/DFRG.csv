knewbie,False,2019-06-03 11:06:00,6.68,Covered DFRG 667 from 673 with 2000 shares 120 Not what I wanted but I got tired of waiting for the flush Since Im the master of covering early the flush might come today Good luck to all
PD23,,2019-06-03 10:20:00,6.725,DFRG not bearish but that report claimed news would come out at their investor meeting at the end of May and still nothing
