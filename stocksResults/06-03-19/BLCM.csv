brindledog,,2019-06-03 15:41:00,1.95,BLCM Wow Why is this just so so bad
Cosmicinvestor,,2019-06-03 15:36:00,1.94,BLCM wont be surprised if the company that wants to acquire this through Proxies is trashing the stock to buy it cheap It happens in Bio world
JSTBiotech,True,2019-06-03 15:29:00,1.95,BLCM from 10K Given where stock is trading its virtually impossible to raise any meaningful capital they burn 100M a year Likely one of the strategic transactions will have to occur
ChartMill,,2019-06-03 15:26:00,1.955,The technical rating of BLCM is bad and it also does not present a quality setup at the moment chartmillcomanalyzephpu
hotsaucedd,,2019-06-03 15:14:00,1.915,BLCM This stock is uninvestable right now They need to announce non dilutive raise of capital to stop the bleeding
Cosmicinvestor,,2019-06-03 15:00:00,1.935,BLCM may 16th 8 up on no ne s 14 sessions and lost 38 on no negative news with good ASCO data This is how low float biotechs are attacked by predator funds to shakeout and get low Unbelievable manipulation of this stock
Cosmicinvestor,False,2019-06-03 13:35:00,1.9,BLCM ASCO data release as per tradition we lost 8 If this isnt manipulation I dont know what is it Rick Fair is the worst CEO cant gain 15 cents on data means we r a penny stock soon

Cosmicinvestor,,2019-06-03 13:25:00,1.955,BLCM 12 swing on a data release cant keep a 10 penny gain Seriously Board of Directors and Rick should be jailed
LXP,,2019-06-03 13:24:00,1.946,BLCM Im out Huge loss GLL
Cosmicinvestor,False,2019-06-03 13:23:00,1.955,BLCM even if they cure cancer big money can trash it for a 5 or 25 loss Unbelievable Asshole Rick destroying the company Another Asshole hire in Europe is doing nothing either
LXP,,2019-06-03 13:15:00,1.975,BLCM I may take the loss here
Roni50,,2019-06-03 13:12:00,1.96,BLCM i am out

optionchained,,2019-06-03 12:57:00,1.985,BLCM
Cosmicinvestor,,2019-06-03 12:48:00,1.997,BLCM Asshole Rick is trashing the company ASCO day is worth 3 at all time low Wow No sense or rhyme reason not until fund balancing is done Amazing
Aisin,,2019-06-03 12:33:00,1.995,BLCM wow dilution seems to weigh in minds more than data I think
Greenhornet2018,,2019-06-03 11:49:00,2.04,BLCM this stock needs time once the hedge boys decide its time to buy Pow spikedrop Have your trailing stops locked on this one it will be a quicky
Cosmicinvestor,,2019-06-03 11:41:00,2.05,BLCM big funds are carefully adjusting between their accounts and MM is diligent in working his orders Manipulation at its finest Even if they cure cancer it wont go up 2
mifunego,,2019-06-03 11:14:00,2.045,BLCM Confirmation that cash balance and the specter of dilution is more important than data at least for today
Cosmicinvestor,,2019-06-03 10:26:00,2.076,BLCM so much for ASCO data as always we got 4 cent gain at all time low Asshole Rick is a disgrace and will never have another career opportunity in Biotech after this disaster
hotsaucedd,,2019-06-03 10:04:00,2.08,BLCM well apparently latest data is not a stock mover Not surprised Rivo data next I may dip my toes in here
