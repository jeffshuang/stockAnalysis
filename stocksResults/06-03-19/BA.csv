keithh1989,,2019-06-03 09:34:00,336.225,BA this company has a perfect opportunity to just hurry up and bottom out at 250 cut all losses due to the crash in march which reviled a major flaw in some of aircraft models it could use the china trade war as a mask and then restabilized when the dow jones most likely bottoms out at 22500 23000 however the media talking this and that trying to keep it afloat is nothing but manipulation kind of reminds me back in the day when mad cow was going around and they were down playing saying it was secluded and contained lol ppl make mistakes lets just get it over with already then it bottom out restructure climb back bc 2020 will be an interesting year
