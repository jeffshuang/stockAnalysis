iwanderer,False,2019-06-03 10:39:00,3.656,VLRX JohnnyMaJun 3rd 1026 am waiting for the short squeeze b4 though did u see the short float on thisShort squeeze is a complete myth See attached chart The day SP went up 5 the short volume went up to 31 But the following days short volume went down accordingly to around 20 I think there will be more shorts when the ATM offer is announced The ATM offer price can be as low as 2 just my speculation based on previous VLRXs offerings WAIT for ATM offer b4 BUY so one can have the reasonable entry point GLTA Longs
