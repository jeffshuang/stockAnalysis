DrinkingDru,,2019-06-03 10:23:00,122.989,SPOT Too many kids just dont remember when all you had was radio and you had to BUY every LP CD you wanted to listen to Even the days of 99 cent MP3s are going going gone SPOT charges 15 a month for me to listen to pretty much EVERY CD and piece of vinyl I every bought 1000s over the years starting with my first vinyl of Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1976 And that price is for my entire family They could charge 50mo and I would GLADLY pay it Seems like the only people really getting Fd here are the artists For the record I swing trade this stock all the time up and down but LT I think they do the best job for their listeners and theyre gonna come out on top
