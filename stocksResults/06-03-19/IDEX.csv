merchvent,,2019-06-03 11:04:00,1.323,IDEX This price level is foiling WUs plans to do a 30 million share offering priced 30c below current market value He needs that 180200 to screw you with a fund raising dilution priced at 135 Any offering he does here knocks it down under 1

Techboi,False,2019-06-03 11:00:00,1.33,IDEX looking at the current options contracts for the 250 calls you can already tell interest here is very bearish with no volume some days and open interest in the low 1000 contracts There really is not any bullish interest in calls all the way until next year which contracts end on January 2020 Looking at even the 5 and 7 calls for January both have open interest of 15 7 respectably which is pathetic for long calls on any stock Enjoy the ride kids I got my bait set at 88 cents
