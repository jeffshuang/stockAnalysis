StackedBid,,2019-06-03 09:33:00,0.314,AMRH In my opinion a RS is unlikely in the shortterm There are only 6 trading days left until the compliance date They must maintain a 1 price for 10 trading days to be in compliance so even if they RS today they wouldnt make compliance anyways That means they will either be delisted or get an extension If they get an extension they have 180 days to get their stock price above 1 No need to RS in the next month when they have 6 months to organically get their price above 1 which will likely happen with news and continued improvement in earnings
