Pharmclin,True,2019-06-03 15:14:00,1.94,TTOO hpesojnhoj With your negative comment please explain why you are interested in TTOO This post is from a HCP healthcare practitioner who is still in the workforce Back in 2015 this HCP found CPXX stock all by his self bought a boatload at 177 and it was called six months later in 2016 at 3025 CPXX wasnt even a new drug it was the same two drugs that had been used for years to treat AML But the same ole drugs were in a new formulation TTOO will be just fine with time

hpesojnhoj,False,2019-06-03 14:01:00,1.93,TTOO this stock is a true POS
sdbluestem,True,2019-06-03 11:40:00,1.94,TTOO to say the blood test that identifies more than 90 of pathogens in sepsis is inadequate or has limited utility is like saying that a blood test that only detects breast colorectal lung ovarian pancreatic gastric or bile duct cancer but not brain or bone cancer is incomplete and inadequate In the pipeline Watch for it
Pharmclin,,2019-06-03 10:52:00,1.96,TTOO Esau815 pardon me but what rock are you under My experience is 35 years inside an acute care hospital system including patient deaths from sepsis Speed is of the essence Where did AST come from are you referring to AST aka SGOT used as a test for liver damage Appears as through you are attempting to drive down TTOO for reasons unknown Positive folks on this panel are licensed health care practitioners
