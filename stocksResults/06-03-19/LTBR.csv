Dbowlin,True,2019-06-03 15:10:00,0.7425,LTBR I think bc is right I think well here about them producing the rods before utilities but not sure how much value thatll bring to SP

ECerus,,2019-06-03 13:13:00,0.7259,LTBR IF LTBR had any Analyst coverage the Centrus contract would have LTBR spillover That would be nice Word of mouth extrapolation now which doesnt fit the 30 second sound bite rule
BusinessClass,,2019-06-03 13:06:00,0.7282,Perhaps LTBR needs to actually produce rods at Richland with surrogate material before a commercial utility contract can be finalized It could be that manufacturing delayschallenges have been the hold up all this time So that may be an important milestone which allegedly is next at bat

ECerus,,2019-06-03 09:39:00,0.72,LTBR Gave up highlighting the Scientific American article as these last six paragraphs stand on their own LTBRFuel was thoughtfully noted SA didnt HAVE TO included a nonregistered nuclear fuel at allThis article points to the reallife issues that face the DoE NRC in their game of catchup Something to ponder
