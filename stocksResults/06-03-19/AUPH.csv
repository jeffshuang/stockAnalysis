Lunacy,,2019-06-03 15:58:00,6.544,AUPH After a quick once overit seems that ILJIN has let the price action effect their emotions as weve seen here with many retail investors over the monthsyears So much of what they seem angry about is PPSif theyre planning on holding for the long haul what does todays price really matter I will have to reread laterbut this feels like a temper tantrum over price action while throwing in a sidenote that someone is being paid too much
johntall,,2019-06-03 15:57:00,6.54,AUPH I am back on the fence Iljin definitely has skin in the game and is not trying wrestle control away from current managementIt also appears that Iljin wants to commercialize VOC does that mean that AUPH is playing for a BOI have a lot more reading to do
johndoe16,True,2019-06-03 15:54:00,6.523,AUPH The reason the stock price action sucks is because we keep diluting Stop raising money and up we go
jspillner,,2019-06-03 15:52:00,6.546,AUPH reads as if ILJIN is the one who wants to commercialize
tmojo,,2019-06-03 15:52:00,6.546,AUPH this is great stuff folksread both arguments and digest it allhopefully more to come
youcalledownthethunder,True,2019-06-03 15:51:00,6.55,AUPH well they went nuclear Have never seen something like this We need a white knight ASAP Get this thing sold They articulated their grievances in great detail with a lot of red meat Board needs to provide their POV ASAP This in due course nonsense is not enough
SteveTexans,True,2019-06-03 15:50:00,6.54,AUPH Just now hit my trading platform BioTech news AUPH 4 separate articles Holy crap
mmmhmmm,,2019-06-03 15:45:00,6.546,AUPH We had originally proposed four 4 nominees under Aurinias advance notice bylaw to preserve our ability to be responsive to Aurinias circular once released as we did not know at the time at what size the board would be fixed and the advance notice bylaw is inflexible on the ability to later add nominees Now that Aurinia has definitively proposed to fix the number of directors at eight 8 we are proposing a minority slate of three 3 directors for appointment which is consistent with our message Further one of our nominees is proposed to be appointed in lieu of our current representative on the board of directors Dr Hyuek Joon Lee Iljin just pulled the rug out from under AUPHs main argument for voting for current management
mmmhmmm,,2019-06-03 15:43:00,6.54,AUPH Developing a longterm strategy as a standalone pharmaceutical company including fully pursuing Aurinias current and future alternative applications of voclosporin and to move market perception away from a binary bet on the success of voclosporin in treating LN So is Iljin the one who is wanting to turn this into a full blown pharma company Is anyone else reading this part like that
jspillner,,2019-06-03 15:42:00,6.54,AUPH I think Ill print and go over this thing with a fine tooth comb but man theyre in serious conflict with current mgmt or its just worded to sound that way
StockTrader21,,2019-06-03 15:38:00,6.538,AUPH My only issue w Glick was he was way too subdued and lacked real passion to the street and investors I dont want a used car salesman approach either Guy is brilliant and extremely ethical but not the guy you want as the face of a late stage clinical bio He needs to be behind the scenes making most of the critical business decisions
jspillner,,2019-06-03 15:37:00,6.54,AUPH beginning of their letter its looong
AuntMarie,True,2019-06-03 15:36:00,6.54,AUPH Thank you SteveTexans for precisely wording the current state of affairs ILJIN is acting in the best interest for ILJIN and AUPH board is acting in the best interest for Shareholders
jspillner,,2019-06-03 15:36:00,6.54,AUPH ILJIN letter to shareholders has been filed Im reading on ETrade website
SteveTexans,True,2019-06-03 15:34:00,6.54,AUPH Very simple ILJIN is acting in the best interest for ILJIN and AUPH board is acting in the best interest for Shareholders

Dameistro,True,2019-06-03 15:28:00,6.54,AUPH Commercial Potential of Voclosporin is TremendousYea i know thats why i own this just like you
Labelguy1122,,2019-06-03 15:27:00,6.54,AUPH since announcing positive longterm outcomes for patients suffering from LN followed by a significant public offering of stock in March 2017 Aurinia has failed to communicate or execute a coherent strategy to maintain its momentum and to realize the tremendous potential of voclosporin Shareholders ILJIN included are losing confidence in a board of directors and management team whose interests are increasingly at odds with shareholders as reflected in rising executive compensation minimal stock ownership and an egregious lack of independence There can be no other explanation for the fact that Aurinias share price has failed to move materially over the past two years
Labelguy1122,,2019-06-03 15:24:00,6.541,AUPH Straight from ILJIN mouth To date we have invested 58 million in Aurinia and the future of voclosporin Added Kim We along with all Aurinia shareholders have waited patiently for current leadership to not only advance the commercialization of voclosporin but to do so in a way that shows respect for its public shareholders in terms of financial discipline proper corporate governance and prudent capital raising Unfortunately the current Board has repeatedly failed to meet these responsibilities and change is needed This is a critical time for the Corporation and the Boards leadership will determine if and how value is realized at Aurinia So far this Board has focused primarily on itself not the interests of shareholders We urge shareholders to join us in electing three new independent directors and return control of Aurinias future to all of its shareholders not Aurinia insiders

AuntMarie,True,2019-06-03 15:13:00,6.54,AUPH hmmmiljn is sending out requests to put their own independent members on the boardnot trusting them in the remotest sense Largest Shareholder of Aurinia Pharmaceuticals ILJIN SNT Files Proxy Circular and Issues Letter to Fellow Shareholders
johndoe16,True,2019-06-03 15:09:00,6.57,AUPH Hardly seems fair that companies such as Fidelity get special privileges while many of us have a similar or a better ratio of net worth invested in the company
mmmhmmm,,2019-06-03 14:57:00,6.586,AUPH jspillner had a good idea in another threadwe should all be calling the company right now and demanding more information Call and email 1 250 7442487 is the phone number irauriniapharmacom and bdauriniapharmacom are the emails we want auriniapharmacomcontact is the website if you wish to see for yourself I will not blindly vote in favor of management without them revealing more information They work for me and you Lets remind them of that fact
StockTrader21,,2019-06-03 14:56:00,6.59,AUPH Guilty to admit I have not been following this closely so take this with a grain of salt As I read it high level it sounds like two parties MAY be split One wants to have meaningful and real BO conversations now and the other either wants to wait to increase mkt cap for higher BO price or perhaps commercialize themselves Thoughts on this perspective from those who have been following very closely
Derek1s,,2019-06-03 14:48:00,6.605,AUPH Glickman could offer his 2 cents that would be nice if he could or would

jarepeo,True,2019-06-03 14:08:00,6.59,AUPH I guess wrong over 50 of the time But when I lose I only lose twice as much
johndoe16,True,2019-06-03 14:03:00,6.59,AUPH The top 15 shareholders have a big interest in making this company a success more so than management
johndoe16,,2019-06-03 13:59:00,6.59,AUPH The 15 major shareholders have a big interest in making this company successful More so than management
KeithKarnik,,2019-06-03 13:43:00,6.58,AUPH I feel like the idea behind additional acquisition might not be what it seems does anyone know any other drugs either in development or currently at the same stage as vos with comparable results And if so the board may just be leaving iljin in the dark about a somewhat good market consolidation move Just an idea as always could be wrong just woke up so i apologize if any of that doesnt make sense
Dameistro,,2019-06-03 13:41:00,6.58,AUPH Did anyone ever stop and think it could be complete opposite with ILJIN could have buyer with reasonable offer but the Koreans want it to go to market on our own for the longer term but bigger rewardidk jus rambling who frigen knows blah blah blah
bcx,True,2019-06-03 13:27:00,6.59,AUPH has anyone seen any information on why ILJIN want to muscle into the board 4 deep
Mattastic75,,2019-06-03 13:26:00,6.583,AUPH Just reread the shareholder letter Its kinda funny to see managements frustration w ILJIN Its very diplomatically stated but theyre clearly frustrated Given that it was written by Canadians their mild tone and hint of frustration translates to fullon firebreathing wrath in America Just made me chuckleCanadians are so darn niceI love it
