RayBan1313,,2019-06-03 13:26:00,0.9964,PULM I have a thought about this ST thread It will fry itself once it starts to go up Smartest answer of all time
bwhipple,True,2019-06-03 13:17:00,0.995,PULM I dont know what Sabbys plan is I hope they bought commons and dont have warrants to short against My experience with Sabby is that their presence tends to coincide with a narrow price channel If theyre here to ride the price up and sell for a gain then great Their beneficial ownership is in Volatility Warrant Master Fund Even so I dont know their plan A lot of tutes have major interests in PULM and thats generally a very strong sign Sabby is kind of a pirate tute from the Bahamas Who can anticipate their plan Im still
Scotty_P,,2019-06-03 13:04:00,0.9928,PULM wtf is Sabby lol
rezin8,,2019-06-03 12:59:00,0.9933,PULM if Sabby is a 519 owner that would mean just over 20M shares now outstanding correct
Yu_Darvish,True,2019-06-03 12:59:00,0.9933,PULM sabby probably bought for the ride up and will short it back down since pulm can never keep gains They do make money on both sides I dont believe they just short Bears will scream sabby today so they can scare retail into selling for cheap shares Stay long

The_Future_is_Green,,2019-06-03 11:27:00,1,PULM 1 is the right price it will stay here for some time or until Clark leaves and maybe just maybe there will be no more offerings I will hold judgment until he is gone FYI if you held before the Reverse split any time before Jan2019 and after the 2 major offerings after the RS you are down over 75 on investment I have yet so see the stock hold any gain just 1 or 2 day pump for the offerings
