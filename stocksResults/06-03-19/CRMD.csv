hpdrago,True,2019-06-03 12:14:00,6.186,CRMD This reminds me of NVTA It had a huge drop before it eventually took off Now look where its at Also chart shows a slow bleed instead of a steep drop off I find both of these comforting to some level However I am now in the RED after being green for almost a year so I am not liking this action at all Bottom line nothing has changed We are still waiting

Miketj,,2019-06-03 11:20:00,6.388,CRMD lets hope the feds do NOT lower the interest rates That would be the tipping point to verify that we are in a weak market and an all around bearish market That being said It wont be the first or last time the market turns red Bag holding and adding may be the only choice until things turn around On a positive note Buying in bear markets is the best way to accumulate whatever interests your trading style Buying in bull market makes money but nothing like the potential for profits that may be given soon Good luck and happy trading
