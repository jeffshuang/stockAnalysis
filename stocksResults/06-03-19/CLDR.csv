KeepWaiting,,2019-06-03 10:27:00,8.861,CLDR Loads of selling into earnings Place your bets I guess FYI people even banks and FAs do NOT know whats going to happen with ERs in advance Last ER should be all the proof you need of that This is a gamble but at these prices even a mild surprise could be a home run And worst case scenario now is almost an expectation given the last quarters PA so risk while still very real is mitigated a bit too Ill add at my next target still not worried LT regardless
