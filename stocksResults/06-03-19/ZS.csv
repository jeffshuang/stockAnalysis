jdmarkman,,2019-06-03 12:21:00,66.947,Too often traders look for stocks to buy into declines Buy the dip I get it I do the same most of the timeBut this market is broken I cant stress that enough Lasting declines are about narratives Right now politicians are taking dead aim at investors That means valuation multiples will decreaseLast week I commented that many momentum stocks were acting fine despite the market weakness That is no longer true WDAY ZS and TTD got taken to the woodshed despite excellent results The price investors were willing to pay for growth declined Thats a big problem Politicians believe they are in control They believe the right comment at the right time will force investors back to the long sidePoliticians are naive They may squeeze short sellers temporarily but winning back investors will be much harderI hate it because making money on the short side is much harder but expect rallies to get sold until the narrative changesMore comingShow More
