FightTyranny,,2019-06-03 15:38:00,4.734,NBEV I wrote to NBEV this Sat It is my understanding that many companies including New Age Beverages are waiting for additional clarification from the FDA before rolling out CBD infused beverages I can understand why you need to wait before rolling out CBD infused beverages on a national scale that is obvious However it seems that CBD beverages shouldcould be rolled out in Colorado and California before other national and local companies choose to do so Heineken is already started distributing nonalcoholic CBD and THC infused beverages in California since 2018 If there is no intention to rollout CBD infused products is selected markets where it is legal to do so already including your own backyard please provide additional context why Heineken can legally do it while NBEV is unwillingAll I got back today was Thanks for your comments All else being equal our rollout strategy would be updated on our quarterly earnings calls
