HeyU2001,,2019-06-03 14:59:00,2.28,NBRV Getting through this is not a big deal Not sure why so many divergent opinions First step meet with the FDA to see what deficiencies they were concerned about what corrective actions they are looking for Those corrective actions are put in place with the manufacturer We then file the corrective measures with the FDA and they do their DD and site inspections if required and make a decision This has nothing to do with the drug today From the CRL they are not concerned with the actual manufacturing Seems to be more of a tracking and management of the Lot production Since millions of scripts are going to be used they need to be able to audit and monitor each MFG lot My guess since the meeting has not happened yet
