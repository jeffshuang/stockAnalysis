Growth,True,2019-06-03 13:48:00,2.72,CLDX I was asked the question so heres my reasoning on being bullish AF here IMO1 Its trading far below cash on hand 6share cash on hand2 Its a low floater low floaters lately have been going off for 1003 They just presented encouraging data at Asco this past weekend4 Has multiple price targets in the double digits and ran that high within past 6 months5 Im really liking the chart set up hitting a double bottom from lows within the past 6 months and getting tight at the end of a falling wedge patternAdmittedly I see the 250s as possible and will start a second position if it gets there Only sharing my DD and this is my opinion not advice Always do your own DD before buying a stock
Growth,True,2019-06-03 13:42:00,2.71,CLDX I was asked the question so to sum up why Im bullish AF here and figured best just to share the DD with all1 Its trading far below cash on hand over 6share cash on hand2 Its a low floater3 They just presented encouraging data at Asco this past weekend4 Has several price targets in the double digits5 Chart looks about ready to go hitting a double bottom in past 6 months and getting tight at the end of a falling wedge patternAs such Im not selling and only adding at these levels Admittedly I view a drop into the 250s as possible and Ill start a second position as I stated earlier if it does Hope this helps and good luck to all
