iotinvestor,True,2019-06-03 12:39:00,12.07,SWIR nfineon Acquires Cypress for 101 Billion to Bolster IoT Position tomshardwarecomnewsinfin Thats 4x Cypresss 25B yearly revenue and CSCO paid 4x for Jasper So that would put SWIR BO valuation 4x 800M around 88 PSI would say we are severely undervalued 12
Heinzboz,,2019-06-03 12:14:00,12.088,SWIR It feels like right now IOT is really starting to come to light for everyone and things are about to get interesting Im hoping the big companies start to feel a sense of urgency to carve out their place in IOT and SWIR can benefit greatly
