WantedToRetireEarly,,2019-06-03 13:48:00,15.643,ENPH I am very happy about how the stock has absorbed the news of BOTH the secondary and the Mexico Tariffs Thats quite a one two punch but of course I think the market is discounting that more than a 5 tariff will ever go into effect because of the really significant impact they will have on the US economy Lets hope the market is right about this and that reason will prevail Very unclear with Trump With China I think that chance of a deal are now dead and that the Chinese will wait things out until 2020
