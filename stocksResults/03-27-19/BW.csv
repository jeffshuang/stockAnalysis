Entrepredoer,True,2019-03-27 13:22:00,0.4289,JAGX BW looking forward to upcoming news by April 2nd or sooner
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 13:01:00,0.4204,BW Maker looking for resistance to rebalance If it drops below 42 could be in for a quick dip Tricky dogs
BearShorter1,False,2019-03-27 13:00:00,0.4204,BW Im anticipating a new LOD Might want to sell if you havent already Can always buy back int the 30s when maker panics
BearShorter1,False,2019-03-27 12:58:00,0.4232,BW As expected looks like they are pushing it down to try to accumulate reload Wouldnt be surprised if some of the bids are fakies

Entrepredoer,True,2019-03-27 12:00:00,0.4328,BW No assumptions until news in the next couple trading days
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 11:56:00,0.4275,BW Id sell and force it down and catch them at their own game Im out until it drops Nice profit for me
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 11:55:00,0.4337,BW See how they just dropped the bid
BearShorter1,False,2019-03-27 11:54:00,0.4398,BW Id surmise they pulled in extra 1mm shares from where they started Ill buy again at dump Cant see them letting it fly before that
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 11:53:00,0.4409,BW With each successive short high buy low they are buying more shares A little more with each cycle When they dump might be nasty
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 11:32:00,0.4479,BW Cant be a squeeze if theyve all filled Sucks because this should have gone into the high 50s with their covers Scalps to blame
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 11:31:00,0.4479,BW If nobody buying and all averaged down into the 30s then who is buying now Looks like shorts covering Theyll short it down again
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 11:01:00,0.4348,BW They cant get anybody to step in bull trap stall My chart says should be trading in 41s without suspected short action Careful
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 10:53:00,0.4395,BW Lets keep eyes peeled for warrant or shares offered for extension So long as no ratcheting warrants and high executions no worries
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 10:52:00,0.4395,BW With no news dont chase Bull trappers dream Stick to your plans If extension costs dilution may not be good news
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 10:50:00,0.4395,BW Current bull trap support of 4251 is a rug pull from 4131 401 3884 3657 and 3401 if bottoms out Those are my scale in buys

BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 10:44:00,0.4277,BW Lord Who put in stop loss and gave them shares You are undercutting yourselves We want it to rubber band down and slingshot up
beatupz,True,2019-03-27 10:43:00,0.436,BW when will they release the hounds
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 10:42:00,0.4341,BW Let them retrace down Buy when it drops Be careful youll need to step in front and they dont like that I wont buy above LOD
BearShorter1,False,2019-03-27 10:41:00,0.4382,BW Interesting to see how they settle the shorts without a gap down Theyll need to trade sideways and theyll need sellers Dont sell
BearShorter1,False,2019-03-27 10:09:00,0.4273,BW Looks like they were shorting that big order Look for it to come down until they fill another 30k in volume They need to fill
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 09:57:00,0.4288,BW There is a 7600 sell at 4345 and thats 125 of current volume Id wonder whats going on if I was Maker too
BearShorter1,,2019-03-27 09:55:00,0.425,BW Looks like well be under 4345 for first half of day I wouldnt mind picking another 15k shares at 40
ChartMill,,2019-03-27 09:55:00,0.425,With a Forward PE of 106 the valuation of BW can be described as cheap chartmillcomanalyzephpu
BearShorter1,False,2019-03-27 09:53:00,0.425,BW They dont expect sells when the setup looks pretty Maker is confused Looks like they want to take down to 41s hedge accumulate
