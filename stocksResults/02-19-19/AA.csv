NNN_SSS,,2019-02-19 12:54:00,28.255,AA I am getting enough of this stock
sell1buy2,True,2019-02-19 12:13:00,28.323,AA if it can get above the 3025 area that will fill in a trading gap and I bet it starts to act a LOT better
sell1buy2,True,2019-02-19 12:11:00,28.339,AA traded 2545 in Q4 so its unlikely that Cap Re OR Wellington got executions on large buys as good as where its trading right now
sell1buy2,True,2019-02-19 11:56:00,28.345,AA Cap Re must really like it they own 25 of the company between their various funds
sell1buy2,True,2019-02-19 11:39:00,28.355,AA from highs last April AA is 55 Steel and Copper stocks appear to be turning the corner and going higher expecting higher for Alcoa
sell1buy2,True,2019-02-19 11:36:00,28.354,AA Wellington and Cap Re were LARGE buyers in Q4 Looks like Wellington bought 277 MIL shs and Cap Re bought more than 12 MIL shares
