TexAce,,2019-02-19 14:44:00,0.7539,AKG This merger with GF has done nothing but hold AKG down Fck GF
TexAce,,2019-02-19 14:38:00,0.7492,AKG what the hell is keeping this down While every other miner is gaining 50 we gained 01 What the hell
semantics,True,2019-02-19 14:04:00,0.7526,AKG still significantly undervalued imo I can see MC hitting 1B
beartooth,,2019-02-19 13:38:00,0.7637,AKG Maybe when gold hits 1400 this will break 80
Maliki,True,2019-02-19 12:48:00,0.7552,AKG We were hitting 80 when gold was at 1320 an now were only up 01 when gold shoots up 20 Seems were still being held down let it run
