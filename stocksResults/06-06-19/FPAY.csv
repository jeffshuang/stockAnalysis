Nathan_Klintworth,True,2019-06-06 15:00:00,0.9154,FPAY no reason why we should be trading this low News or some group will push this stock Its bound to happen
bullgogi,,2019-06-06 11:37:00,0.9182,FPAY staying nice above the 50ema but damn we really do need more of a push If it goes under 50ema then back to the mid 80s

IrishGreen,,2019-06-06 10:09:00,0.9115,FPAY Ive been holding for months now and Im not planning on quitting at this point Im still aiming for 200 or more The only thing that will get me out of this one is if Howard sells If that happens then Im done
Ammocans,True,2019-06-06 09:57:00,0.9176,FPAY on May 24 the support line moved up to 91 since that time it has tested 91 3 more times I cannot find a support line nearly that high since the drop in October 2018 a single catalyst will send this soaring but it is trading thinly right now so down is always a possibility but the upside looks so good
AViD_Investing,,2019-06-06 09:31:00,0.94,FPAY taking my ball and going home
