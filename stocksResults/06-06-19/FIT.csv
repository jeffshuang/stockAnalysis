ddubller,True,2019-06-06 15:55:00,4.418,FIT I heard from a little bird that if you all remain patient this stock will eventually and should go to 10 so my friends the game is yours do with it what you will if you dont have a position and want one how low are you willing to wait before it goes up when this goes up it will go way up 10 and then who knows with the way the market overexaggerates in the usa it could go to 30 so u know speak to your math buddies really crunch the numbers of this company and you will see that the outlook should be positive its quite rare for a company to be undervalued on the market and I would say this is quite cheap at this level
