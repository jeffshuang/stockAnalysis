roguediabetic2,,2019-06-06 13:38:00,7.172,XERS globenewswirecomnewsrele I never liked the whole idea of this being a stepping stone to a bionic pancreas which is totally absurd and wont work Apparently someone has a jump on Xeris with that however Xeris is working on similar technology Given the data I see no rational reason that would preclude xeriject from being approved except ER docs ambulance drivers and endocrinologists wont like it because if diabetics arent reliant on them it threatens their incomes so

KeepRollin,,2019-06-06 12:23:00,7.29,XERS It appears to be a leak now Especially if the product does not get approved on Monday this shows a leak on the information A must lawsuit Every few years these companies come out and do exactly the same Last years it was MBIO ALRN MTEM and now thisThey start a year before approval dates Evaluate themselves based on future approval Then retail shares to ordinary holders Then it goes from 25 to 6 A common stockholder cannot double their investment all the time Then at 6 or 5 they release some news that takes them to 10 While standard holder sits at 25 The friends double triple their investment at the bottom from 5 to 10 while the long waits for 25 to come and which of course never does
