Vanderbilt,,2019-06-06 11:45:00,4.88,NTEC This Stk reminds me of CATS 6 months ago every time it got above 975 they sold the crap out of it Yet managements quarterly reports were awesome I couldnt figure it out I thought maybe someone got some insider bad news As it turned out management was right and stk exploded to 21 I feel the same way about NTEC I dont understand price action but Im not selling I just wish Cohodes was not in the Stk as I think he is cursed
