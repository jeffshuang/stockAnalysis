contrarianspeculator,,2019-06-06 14:53:00,4.269,JVA risking 50 cents to make 150 is not a bad venture at all What say you
contrarianspeculator,True,2019-06-06 14:51:00,4.253,JVA as soon as the bearish sentiment dominates the shares will turn higher quickly We are almost thereAt this point I assess about 50 cents of downside risk but a potential reward of three times that amount Not a bid risk to reward ratio of 30
