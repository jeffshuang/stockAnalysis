dysh0686,,2019-06-06 09:30:00,30.042,AMD It very well might go over 30 today but it has no support and would continue to display the extreme volatility going forward AMD needs to build a solid foundation around here like it did around 26 so it can hold 30 permanantly when it actually has the revenues to deserve it No prediction just my opinion
