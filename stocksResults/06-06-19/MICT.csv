wannabstrong,,2019-06-06 15:07:00,0.7858,MICT when do tendered shares get returned
horst80,,2019-06-06 14:39:00,0.7801,MICT getting a lot worse once tendered shares returned and dumped
HamburgerJung71,,2019-06-06 13:53:00,0.7867,MICT I would have expected some reaction from MICT today that the news flow is better planned to limit shareholder losses But we are alone in the rain Or had the board of MICT not expected this reaction
BDeepAndThrusting,,2019-06-06 13:31:00,0.8173,MICT not to mention the terms of the convertibles were not disclosed Really Not going to mention the interest rate
santaredhatman,True,2019-06-06 13:11:00,0.82,MICT more good news coming
ski67,True,2019-06-06 13:05:00,0.82,MICT I am wondering if MICT could now get revised up to 1 share of MICT equals 1 share of GFH instead of 92 since they have more outstanding shares now plus the possibility of acquiring all of MICT Israel with all this new cash
BDeepAndThrusting,,2019-06-06 12:46:00,0.7806,MICT Lucatz should be in cuffs What happened to all his shares that he sold at 165 Blatantly unethical at best
