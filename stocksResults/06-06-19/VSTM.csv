Tacto,True,2019-06-06 10:30:00,1.25,VSTM When I typed VSTM in the search box at investingcom this morning there were two choices One is Nasdaq which is the only one thats been there for at least the past couple of years The new one today is actually showing 2013 from June 7th and CBOE Someone is doing some weird shit in the background because not coincidentally nearly all of the manipulation is done on four CBOE exchanges EDGX BZX EDGA and BYX There is actually a third choice which is the one in Germany but you have to drill down further to see that option
