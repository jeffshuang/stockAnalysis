bombaywala46,,2019-06-06 15:57:00,49.36,YTRA EBIX Yatra share holders what you have got into Take your management to task for the sorry state of your company Guess what would happen now if Ebix decides to walk away
Stuart60611,,2019-06-06 13:14:00,48.685,Only thing keeping YTRA from now crashing to 250 or lower is the hope that EBIX may still want to buy it at a deep discount after the criminal charges yesterday for balance sheet forgery
Stuart60611,,2019-06-06 12:55:00,48.642,If EBIX still wants YTRA after the criminal charges brought against it yesterday for forging balance sheets EBIX should be able to pick it up real cheap as EBIX now has all the leverage as YTRA PPS is crashing and now really needs EBIX to save it from imploding
Stuart60611,,2019-06-06 11:46:00,48.505,EBIX With the election now out of the way I suspect we will soon hear from the Indiaregulators on the BSE insurance joint venture I suspect hold up was largely caused by political uncertainty associated with the election
bombaywala46,,2019-06-06 09:52:00,48.445,EBIX YTRA Sadly management has not learnt lessons yet After the stock will take beating they will come out in a perfunctory manner with some Yatra updates to clarify the situation They are dumb and deaf to say the least
