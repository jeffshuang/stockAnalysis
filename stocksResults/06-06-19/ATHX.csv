Brasky84,,2019-06-06 12:43:00,1.595,ATHX The stock needs dataapprovals to draw off the shorts and get buyers in Theres no volume and no liquidity Long only mutual funds will begin buying and you wont sniff hedge funds until liquidity is 5 Milday normally 10 but some smaller players will flirt It all begins with the dataapprovals Without that it will continue to float around this and people will trade it Simple as that If your in for a buy and hold wait for the dips
bobjoe,True,2019-06-06 12:31:00,1.591,ATHX Low volume days without big news announcements allows share prices to slump and the shorts to issue self fulfilling prophecies It also allows accumulation by institutions at low prices Under the surface relative strength Long term base but not quite ready to take off Needs 2 on volume

CirrusTrading,True,2019-06-06 11:45:00,1.588,ATHX I remember when we hit 2 a few weeks ago and I said I wonder if this is the last time this will happen and we wont be able to buy back in the 150s Guess this isnt it
MrStealYourShares,True,2019-06-06 10:01:00,1.609,ATHX looks like everyone forgot about us might see a break below support today with the lack of volume Gonna add big again if we get to 140s
