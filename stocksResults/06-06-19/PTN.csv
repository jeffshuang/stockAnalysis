Ivo8,,2019-06-06 15:42:00,1.274,PTN Palatin Technologies has done a large Phase 2 trial to prove this with the conclusionWe found a transient rise in the BP Blood pressure accompanied by a reduction in the HR Heart rate following bremelanotide The levels of BP were not related to drug exposure and persistent moderate or severe hypertension did not occur on any dose of bremelanotideThe final FDA decision will have a strong impact on future sales and on the licensing deal for Europe Another important point would be the extended label for men as the drug does work for both genders Here it is important to understand that the drug works on the central neural system which is a different mechanism from the existing ED erectile dysfunction drugs and therefore targets unmet medical needs
Ivo8,,2019-06-06 15:42:00,1.274,PTN Facing a binary decisionIn the last AMAG presentation on the analyst day AMAGs CEO William K Heiden mentioned that the company is in negotiation with FDA for the labeling and is fairly optimistic about the approval ability of Vyleesi However investors should be aware that a binary decision is incoming for Palatin Technologies Also the additional Phase I results were not published so it is still unclear whether the drug will receive a clean label or not So far the information from AMAG representative Julie Krop Chief Medical Officer to the question Can you give any feedback on how the ABPM study turned out is thatWe feel that is very consistent to our prior dataNote here that the FDA demanded an additional trial because the drug was once formulated in intranasal treatment Because of the intravenous formulation the drug showed only transient signs of high blood pressure which could be a side effect of sexual excitement
