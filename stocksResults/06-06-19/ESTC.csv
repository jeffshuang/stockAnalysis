jason397,,2019-06-06 14:46:00,80.395,ESTC correctionI thought quiet period was over the day after the Q2 ER but it is actually 3 business days after end of quiet period which would be this coming TuesdaySo any insider selling that may take place could happen on Tuesday Usually the stock lock expiration is a big nothing burger but if anything it seems there is just pressure on the stock on the way to the expirationThis means I see a good chance of higher volumes and upside next week But I am still buying more at these levels anywayif I miss the bottom by a couple dollars it wont matter much when the stock is 120 or 150 in a year
