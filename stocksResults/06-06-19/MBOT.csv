MoBleusa,,2019-06-06 14:34:00,4.99,MBOT According to the 10K theyre still looking for 2H 2019 for FDA submission Havent seen any presentations since fall 2018 where Harel Gadot could say otherwise Also see theyre appealing the court decision with the Sabby case holding 4Million frozen until the appeal is done This is good because they dont have to pay anything to the other two hedge funds from the tolling agreement for the time being Once the appeal process ends which should take a while the company expects FDA submission and will hopefully be at a high enough valuation that all 3 hedge funds will want their shares
