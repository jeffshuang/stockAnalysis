Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-06 12:28:00,3.925,GALT Been thinking about that GILD deal with Scholar Rock I suspect that GILDs acquisition of Scholar Rock makes sense to pair their TGFb inhibitor a fibrogenic mediator with Galts GRMD02 Would it be a partnership Or a complete acquisition Who knows time will tell but Ill be ready either way Orin

Tiggerrrr,True,2019-06-06 11:30:00,3.935,GALT vs ICPT nonapproved drug vs approved drug Based on how the ICPT board members keep bashing GALT indicates to me the fear you have that a 45 stock will steal your thunder in due time The safety profile of GALT is not comparable AT ALL to that of ICPTs Big key difference there Oh and dont forget ICPT guys your BILE WILL ALWAYS BE VILE GL though BILEISVILE
ChoppedLiver1,,2019-06-06 11:01:00,3.92,GALT Its just so funny as well as completely hypocritical how GALT fanboy pumpers accuse realistic GALT shareholders of being short and then bash other companies relentlessly Show some class dumbass its a big world out there If and when GALT has an approved drug the other companies wont matter

Scarliver,,2019-06-06 09:40:00,3.981,GALT ICPT does nothing and its toxic where it matters most end stage avoiding liver decompensation Nothing left for late stage NASH So what about GALT Why arent we being recognized Stay tunedIts coming
