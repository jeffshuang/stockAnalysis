LongInvestor1,True,2019-06-06 14:33:00,7.411,ABIO The daily chart suggests we could go parabolic over 847 Would love to see 1314 again Time will tell GLTAL
LR18,,2019-06-06 14:26:00,7.423,ABIO On watch list for being a thin floater looks due for move
ChartMill,,2019-06-06 14:17:00,7.38,ABIO is valued rather cheaply when comparing the Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio to the industry average of 956 chartmillcomanalyzephpu
Ariel69,True,2019-06-06 14:07:00,7.398,ABIO come on baby you can break 8 again
DGCustomCLT,True,2019-06-06 13:43:00,7.4,ABIO 747 Charts still looking great
caad,,2019-06-06 12:36:00,7.244,ABIO good upward movement Now lets break 737
Ariel69,True,2019-06-06 12:18:00,7.231,ABIO hopefully shell run after lunch
Ariel69,,2019-06-06 12:02:00,7.242,ABIO I think everyone was at CTRV it was going nuts earlier hoping they come back here
Hou_Trader1,True,2019-06-06 10:41:00,7.203,ABIO I think we have sellers lurking but they dont want to sell at these prices or there isnt enough volume for them to unload their shares The longer we hold this level the better I wouid expect buyers to become impatient seeing the sp holding and fomo sets in
Hou_Trader1,True,2019-06-06 10:35:00,7.22,ABIO that cldr is hovering around 5 now Very interesting to see what it does for learning experience See what I am talking about
caad,,2019-06-06 10:33:00,7.19,ABIO break 737 and go to 780 lets see
Hou_Trader1,True,2019-06-06 10:31:00,7.19,ABIO The further we move away from 7 the better this looks overall When traders see whole and half numbers they are mental resistance points
Hou_Trader1,,2019-06-06 10:24:00,7.19,ABIO watching cldr now its down big but could rebound anytime Interesting to watch
P19J87K,True,2019-06-06 10:19:00,7.263,ABIO If this breaks past 745 then this get back to 8
Hou_Trader1,True,2019-06-06 09:49:00,7.32,ABIO I dont see the sellers drinking red bull all morning present We may have sellers lurking but they are probably smoking weed I always try to analymixes the mindset of the traders lol
Hou_Trader1,True,2019-06-06 09:44:00,7.2,ABIO So far looking good No downward pressure to push below 7 so that is very positive
TheSlimTrader,True,2019-06-06 09:42:00,7.2,ABIO if you are down and havent sold then dont This is the stock that breaks your heart as soon as you sell
