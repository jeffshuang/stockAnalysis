Arctophylax,,2019-06-06 10:40:00,1.841,APTO I dont want to hear it from anyone who thinks I havent done diligence or am whining The ceo if the company said re 806 on the May 7 cc So over the next week or two weeks if we can get this first patient on alright its been a month Is the patient on This is not complicated We listen to what the ceo says we do our dd is he delivering or not Then the ceo goes on to say eight or more patients to discuss by ASH Still true This MATTERS
