Congostockchat,True,2019-06-06 10:47:00,1.97,XXII ladies and gentlemen make no mistake about it There are not only big tobacco Representatives on this board but people from this whole Panda Network and those involved in shorting the stock all the way down under a dollar They pose under all kinds of names here Actually I believe that this is the number one and only reason why Henry did that big 50 million dollar capital raise Although I disagreed with it initially I actually think he did exactly the right thing There is no stopping this train now The panda will be destroyed XXII VLN Prepare for approval
