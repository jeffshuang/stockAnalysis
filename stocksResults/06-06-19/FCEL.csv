dezze,,2019-06-06 13:41:00,0.5258,FCEL this is tempting there is value here even in worse case scenario when you look carefully at structure of assets and liabilities I am thinking mostly from an FCELB perspective here I am not as concerned about servicing needs as Henrik Alex In a restructuring worse case they could spin off servicing arm with rights to tech and expertise etc the energy produced and PPAs tied to the assets have value It would be interesting to know how some debt may be tied to those productive assets Also would be interesting to see Henriks balance sheet assumptions and even cash flow assumptions Eg 27M cash on hand last quarter A 10M burn means 82 of Hercules debt This is not to deny that BK might happen to help with restructuring but I think it may not be as bad as could be and idea that recovery is too late or impossible seems overdoneIMO Restructuring could lead to something substantial here even for common shareholders a buyer or new partner would change everything

Fostecare,,2019-06-06 10:39:00,0.5068,FCEL One great moment in the history of FCEL was not entirely their own It was between 20092011 I would access the charts to confirm it but after 2 reverse stock splits it seems no longer possible The numbers inexplicably do not match Back then FCEL was at or near 50 cents and PLUG having the spotlight on them and exploding to 11 made it so FCEL grabbed hold of PLUGs coattails and rocketed to 535 FCEL would not have had that moment had it not been for PLUG A great moment for investors nonetheless So it is I find myself reminiscing about FCELs once glorious past now that they are seemingly fated to meet a sad and awful end
