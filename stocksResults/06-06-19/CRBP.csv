BleuHorshoe,True,2019-06-06 13:59:00,6.561,CRBP Biotechs are getting hit hard today as more money flows to defensive stocksbonds on trade war fears However the callput ratio on this thing is looking extremely bullish and favorable for a major upswing in the coming 6 weeks to 3 months In the near term I wouldnt be surprised to see an explosion to the 750850 range on good EULAR news and if trade tensions ease Also seeing more hedge funds buying shares
