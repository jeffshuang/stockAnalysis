issapunk,True,2019-06-06 10:52:00,6.63,CRMD Volume is crap today I was hoping yesterdays momentum would bleed into today If we get volume this could def go past 7 today
soma_,True,2019-06-06 10:42:00,6.565,CRMD weekly candle looks good but daily forming resistance at 693 needs to bounce hard and or hold 654 support I still think we renter 546646 range over next 2 weeks for intraday for buys imo wait for that range or some reversal confirmation getting over 693 GL with your positions
