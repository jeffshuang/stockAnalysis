eyvan,True,2019-06-06 15:07:00,1.446,IDEX wtf I listened to the shorts and waited for the drop to 1 to buy more
pgda,True,2019-06-06 14:57:00,1.41,IDEX There are 253 million shares short which must be covered The real float is only 6 million Actual float is 40 million but almost 34 million are literally locked by stubborn knowledgeable longs who studied this stock thoroughly and retail longs bought at higher levels and they will sell only above 10 This stock will trade in double digits by the end of this year

Techboi,False,2019-06-06 14:18:00,1.355,At these levels two pumpers came all a sudden with interest to invest heavily and with outrageous rumors like a NIO partnership and more crypto nonsense Dont you guys understand that crypto is not what you should be focused on Its having a product services and clients No having GTB BTC ETH yes that stuff good but thats long term investments a company would do Focus on profit and products not rumours IDEX Shorted this pop fyi enjoy the weekend Ill take my catnip and overdose tonight
cdewder,,2019-06-06 14:07:00,1.35,IDEX and NIO together Interesting NIO might need a new source of debt Ideanomics can provide ABSdebt

NickyD88,,2019-06-06 12:46:00,1.34,IDEX actually looking a bit bullish today If I wasent so used to being abused by this stock I would be mildly excited
MrBlockchain,True,2019-06-06 12:37:00,1.37,IDEX If you have been avoiding the falling knife might wanna see a shrink to get passed that fear Do you own enough
WarrowJ,True,2019-06-06 12:21:00,1.32,IDEX Basic research and a call to IR showstells you that the company has more than 280M in crypto on hand with 3 relatively solid coins GTB ETH BTC they are invoicing for nearly 200 million monthly have 2 prepayments for taxis coming in within 24 weeks not sure how that affects bottom line accounting wise I expect EPS for Q2 of at least 35 Cash on hand should 20X as well to sit around 40 million should draw attention Somewhat difficult to assess the float Also confuse about how they crypto is valued on the report but my theory is that when they bring it in house they will need to write up the assets almost restating earnings up in a big way The positions from institutions here is pathetic though still a few pieces of the company that look like distractions but the move to offload weird tentacles looks like a move in the right direction The history of the ticker is a little scammy looking but Ive seen it before so whatever Need to research more on the CEO now
HoneyBajr,,2019-06-06 11:47:00,1.31,IDEX to raise money for NIO Wouldnt be surprised The partnership makes sense considering a deal has already been made with the largest China car manufacturer Foton I see BYDDF deal also a possibility in future
BigDic,True,2019-06-06 11:36:00,1.33,IDEX wow my buy spiked this up Crazy
WarrowJ,True,2019-06-06 11:34:00,1.33,IDEX guy on my floor says a tie up between NIO and Ideanomics is being announced in a few days Lets see what that does Would have been a lot better for Ideanomics if NIO wasnt trading like horse crap
MrBlockchain,True,2019-06-06 11:31:00,1.33,IDEX What Doesnt anyone else wanna sell
forsure,True,2019-06-06 09:49:00,1.3,IDEX green
