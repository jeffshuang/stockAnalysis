saxy4u,,2019-06-06 15:09:00,1.748,ONCY alright Management Fantastic job getting big Pharma interested to create bidding war but the only thing going to move this needs upper Management to buy a lot of shares This will then get the Tutes feeling that you are also sure about the success Buy you bastards
aaron03,,2019-06-06 14:18:00,1.748,ONCY This is very disappointing Extremely positive news yesterday And for the 2nd day in a rowwere currently red
saxy4u,,2019-06-06 12:48:00,1.75,ONCY fuck off
ChartMill,,2019-06-06 12:38:00,1.75,ONCY has a Current Ratio of 339 so it is financially healthy and has no problem in meeting its obligations chartmillcomanalyzephpu
aaron03,True,2019-06-06 09:46:00,1.78,ONCY I expect ONCY to run up today Yesterdaysomeone built a large position Results of SOLTI trial should be coming out next week according to Matt Merck Pfizer and Roche are the companies who are competing to buy out ONCY Im hoping the results of the trial will be extremely revealing and will start a bidding war for ONCY
