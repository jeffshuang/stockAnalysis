Mattastic75,,2019-06-06 15:53:00,6.37,AUPH I still think we see the SP coil down to 615 625 before it shoots higher The trading pattern on this stock since its inception is that it likes to coil before any significant move higher Take this with a grain of salt Its just my observation from past trading patterns I personally am not trading this stockIve already backed up the truck and am waiting for a buyout
jarepeo,True,2019-06-06 15:23:00,6.429,AUPH sp goes up and down But support has been rising constantly Remember 600 620 It looks fairly solid here at 640 and I assume that it is just going to go up steadily with exceptions to news

Lunacy,,2019-06-06 15:00:00,6.417,AUPH Had a nice conversation with Auph IR todayExpect Greenleaf to address the ILJIN situation both at the upcoming conferences as well as releasing a formal rebutalAny updates on canine DES program would come from Merck but great opportunity to share IP for future human clinical trial design protocols from Mercks dataPH3 readout by end of yearDDI study data is almost always only used for to support regulatorysubmission purposes and highly unlikely it will be released to publicBOD independence seems to be ILJINs 1 issue
r_csiszar,True,2019-06-06 14:59:00,6.417,AUPH this bleed feels never ending I have a bad feeling

Mattastic75,,2019-06-06 14:01:00,6.4,AUPH So Greenleaf is presenting at the Jeffries Healthcare Conference tomorrow Curious if we get any news Would be great if he made some positive headlines with his presentation to help deflate this move by ILJIN
Mr_Feynman,,2019-06-06 13:58:00,6.41,AUPH Anyone know the reason bio is getting hit harder vs the overall market today

AuntMarie,True,2019-06-06 13:56:00,6.41,AUPH it appears from the less than brilliant comments below that some clearly do not undertand our company at all I do however wish them very well Credible science will prevail in the long term i am holding long and consider this derisked and did quite a while ago
NewsExtra,False,2019-06-06 13:42:00,6.41,AUPH Setting up for the waterfall currently below mid BB on daily 600 million market cap here is a joke Plenty of inventory and shares to dilute to fund their pipe dream

Dream_Catcher,,2019-06-06 12:13:00,6.41,AUPH I hate my shares getting bullied around on such low volume We need someone to come in and buy 2500000 shares wheres Sparty

johntall,True,2019-06-06 11:51:00,6.42,AUPH I am at a loss to explain why there is so little interest demand for this stock The information about prior trials as well as the teed up design of P3 should make this a guaranteed home runMy hope is that I just do not understand the finer points of investing and not that the folks with stroke know something that I will eventually wish that I had known before
franzenomics,,2019-06-06 11:49:00,6.41,AUPH are these morons planning to ruin this investment just short of the finish line
r_csiszar,True,2019-06-06 11:42:00,6.435,AUPH I think us longs deserve AUPHY to be where CTRV is by now
UT_RPh,True,2019-06-06 11:40:00,6.423,AUPH IMO the low volume and further price drop is to the uncertainty caused by ILJIN They were complaining about SP and a position that has decreased They could have calculated a winwin for themselves 1 win if they were successful and getting more board members 2 Of plan A did not work then the uncertainty would suppress SP and they could pick up more shares cheaper Just a thought any thoughts
paperjam,,2019-06-06 11:34:00,6.44,AUPH Although there are serious cracks in ILJINs story I personally dont have such a negative sentiment for them Im fine with the current board but its also true that relationships on boards can and do get very cosy over time and remember there can also be a negative twist to board members BP history I think their action will make the board more cautious because they can repeat the same show next year I think theyve overdone it this time with 3 new people but maybe that was the whole purpose of it and their only goal Cheers

Mattastic75,,2019-06-06 10:26:00,6.476,AUPH way to go ILJINyoure fing this up for all of us You know you can both have legit concern and handle it productively This was such a low odds attempt though that I truly question your motives WTF are you trying to accomplish Theres just no way you were ever going to get 51 of the votes for your measure to pass so your end game is yet unknown

flyhigh7,,2019-06-06 09:39:00,6.498,AUPH He stated to me Greenleaf is all about preparing AUPH to get VOC to market and further the value of the other indications He also feels strong about increasing share holder value Really no new information for us longs but a refreshing change of attitude in keeping All share holders better informed Thanks again Glenn
flyhigh7,True,2019-06-06 09:38:00,6.498,AUPH Talked to Glenn Schulman yesterday great conversation He is making a real effort to reach out to ALL share holders to communicate the companys direction and answer any questions This is a nice change from previous IR departmentThanks GlennHe conveyed to me they are perplexed by ILJIN move and the timing of such a move As Neil mentioned earlier ILJIN vetted Greenleaf before his acceptance So my thoughtwhy not give him some time to implement change We talked about the additional extended study that was implemented by AUPH not required by the FDA He was not 100 sure why Glickman implemented the study but felt like this would help during the label phase of FDA approval He also said that about 80 of patients were rolling into the study but was not positive of that number The study is also a blind study
