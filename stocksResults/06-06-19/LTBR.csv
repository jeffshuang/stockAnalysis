BusinessClass,,2019-06-06 13:34:00,0.675,LTBR I think whatever catalyst exists thatll take this over 1 may not be hit til NEXT year which is beyond whats required by NASDAQ to avoid a reverse split I dont sense urgency on the parts of Nuscale a utility or the DOE to advance the fuel Seth has positioned himself to benefit regardless of how long it takes and in some ways the longer it takes the more he benefits though Im confident he wants LTBR to stay in business in one form or another As OwlIn pointed out their options are so far underwater it is not something they even factor into their compensation I am not seeing much incentive for them to avoid a reverse split or appetite to accelerate anything Its possible a milestone could be hit any day but the stock is not trading like it will The dilution and vague timelines dont point to that either Im surprised we are holding the 70 cent range and am not sure how much longer we will The GAIN voucher is the only solid step forward Ive seen but we need more
