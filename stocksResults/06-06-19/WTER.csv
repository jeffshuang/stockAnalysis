WealthSmart,,2019-06-06 15:35:00,1.58,WTER ive been looking at this stock but tbh i wouldnt add yet Its trading very similarly to SCU and have very similar stories too Both made the mistake of jumping on the Weed craze and are now suffering unfairly despite good financials I expect this to trade lower towards 1 and then sideways for a little while Just my opinion based on a similar trade i made a while ago
