wolverine123,,2019-06-06 09:48:00,1.841,CLSN would be nice to have a short term catalyst to provide some support for the share price like break through for Gen 1 or an uptick in institutional interest I do put both of these items on management They have been unable to convince opinion leaders and institutional investors that the Company is undervalued and they have been slow walking Gen 1 hopefully to save money instead of it being worthless I was wrong about my investment thesis here Tempted to sell but nothing really has changed It was always binary around Thermodox GLTA
