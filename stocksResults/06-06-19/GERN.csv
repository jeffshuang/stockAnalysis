WhamBamMan,,2019-06-06 14:20:00,1.372,GERN based off the chart this is the price where it either drops bad or goes up Best of luck to both
Jabbers,True,2019-06-06 14:18:00,1.37,GERN Congrats to stockholders on providing the long term life line to imet This will get us past ongoing development to possible combo trials and deals Great day Chip is doing a great job Hopefully FDA will see urgency for current cancer patients

Big_Louie,True,2019-06-06 13:50:00,1.385,GERN MM win because they have their company unlimited supply of money keep shorting Gern until invest think they are wrong and sell to them Some day soon Gern short sellers will not be around and that will be when Imet is approved Keep believing we have a great and needed drug
TraderMike2014,,2019-06-06 13:50:00,1.385,GERN Still waiting for EHA

konstantineB,True,2019-06-06 13:26:00,1.375,GERN just picked up another 3 thousand shares
ewheels88,,2019-06-06 13:17:00,1.38,GERN good news will be sold off more than usual due to the biobear market and short sellers have been taking advantage I dont hold a position here but i do own SRRA which has taken a far worse beating following their good news The price action here does not surprise me
PigsGetFat,True,2019-06-06 13:06:00,1.383,GERN Correct me if Im wrongThe main take away is that Scarlet in an abundance of caution and per his leadership style has left open the option of a 150share dilution if and when imet gets to the point of commercialization At which time the drug would have already been a proven winnerBecause if youre worried about paying to get a product to market youve already won when it comes tohaving a productIs this correct I was in a meeting during the actual call so I missed it live
PigsGetFat,True,2019-06-06 12:49:00,1.39,GERN This stock is allergic to good news In the last month weve found out that1 We got the transfer of data back from JNJ 3 months ahead of schedule2 No dilution is on the horizon until near the end of P3 where well either know we have a winner or our hands and a buyout incoming or well know that the drug is garbage Yet Here we are down a nickle Thats dopey I think this is as good of a tea leaves buying opportunity as youre going to get
Mail_Dog,True,2019-06-06 12:46:00,1.385,GERN Im fine with increased comp salaries as long as the Co gets the job done with getting Imet inthrough P3 on to Fda approval Best guess Co will probably be looking at diluting near end of P3 or shortly after Fda nod if that ever happens one day

konstantineB,True,2019-06-06 11:59:00,1.383,GERN I guess Im picking up more cheap shares
PigsGetFat,True,2019-06-06 11:56:00,1.39,GERN not needing to dilute until maybe post P3 sounds derisked to me Seriously
PigsGetFat,True,2019-06-06 11:41:00,1.406,GERN having cash to get through p3 is tantamount to saying that dilution isnt necessary If the drug continues to show promise by the time you need to raise money GERN will have suitors and a much higher sp If p3 isnt working out and the data is bad who cares about dilution we would all be fucked anyway
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:39:00,1.415,GERN I like Chips openness at this point Seems more believable than normal
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:33:00,1.4,GERN they have funds to cover the trial but will not have financial resources to support the entire company over the 3 years until the read out
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:32:00,1.395,GERN Future product acquisition strategy would look different to what they did in the past GERN have inhouse expertise now

mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:30:00,1.397,GERN Partnership not prioritized finding a new partner Much more shareholder value going alone As things advance explore xUS partnerships
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:29:00,1.4,GERN Combinations could be explored but they are complicated
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:29:00,1.4,GERN Goals 1 Get phase three up and running 2 Phase 2 meeting with FDA then look at new indications
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 11:27:00,1.399,GERN Some good questions This one is on RWD It seems we are collecting more data to support Imet

StockieJohnson,,2019-06-06 10:37:00,1.395,GERN Oh my goodnessback to a 1 we go however and unfortunately not surprising We need P2 data and a P3 enrollment update
Big_Louie,True,2019-06-06 10:37:00,1.395,GERN the shorts are putting a lot of money selling Gern trying to break the price down to where they will be happy to take their profits Mean time the company has received great results from ASH and now the latest data shows even better results The greed of some companys that short these stocks hurt investor and try and kill the company from being able to borrow to keep their doors open It is just a shame we work hard to earn money to invest and MM using there companies unlimited funds to hunt stock they can move around and hurt people I believe in Imetelstat will be approved just time will tell
gwik,,2019-06-06 10:34:00,1.395,GERN Bring it downcome on Ill take 1200 of your naked shorts at 137 Lets see it

gwik,,2019-06-06 10:28:00,1.384,GERN Know the shorters are not reading this but screwya Im buying your 139 bs 800 Keep it coming
PigsGetFat,True,2019-06-06 10:24:00,1.388,GERN So it seems the shortshort theory is is that Scarlet is going to walk out today announce 150 dilution drop the mic and exit What happens when he doesnt do that and doesnt dilute Because at these prices the current burn rate and cash on hand he doesnt have to until the end of P3 if ever Scarlet love him and hate him prepares for the worst as he did with JNJ which is why we didnt go belly up by October 1st I dont see dilution until were talking about commercialization at the earliest So again I ask what happens when we dont dilute today
mergingcultures,,2019-06-06 10:23:00,1.39,GERN No words at the moment I need to play the swings better
