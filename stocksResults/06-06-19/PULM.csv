PULM,,2019-06-06 13:05:00,0.9901,PULM not sure how everyone labels this manipulation it has been in a STRONG down trend for 28 months and is simply doing what it does bestgo down if the shorts and bears just continue to hit the bid then it will continue in this trend 093c is in sight and i continue to believe they will test 083c prior to any move up

PULM,,2019-06-06 12:20:00,0.9944,PULM so during the past TWENTY EIGHT MONTHLY BARS thats a lot which i why im screaming it out loud there have been only 2 TWO bars that were technically up bars so is it REALLY any surprise that this continues lower almost daily and I still say that IF they are accumulating could be but not a given unlike what most seem to think they WILL take it below 093 and could take it below 083 to test the will and shake everyone out prior to any move up just my opinion
