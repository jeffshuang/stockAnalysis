KeepRollin,,2019-06-06 15:35:00,1.27,ADMP Watch them announcing the launch and watch the sell They know that you all will sell at anything above 2 therefore watch how they will keep it below 2 so that you have no choice but to cheer until October In this way common shareholders will ruin their summer vacation while Carlo works on his retirement home in San Diego Make sure that you google his address so you can see how rich he has gotten off of you And make sure that you vote for him this Summer Welcome to stuck between 1 and 2 club

is2,,2019-06-06 13:22:00,1.3,ADMP seems like someone wants this company to fail and has insider knowledge
P2Player,,2019-06-06 13:03:00,1.3,ADMP Im surprised that some group hasnt been slowly acquiring shares at this discount to get enough majority to toss these fools out and do a nice hostile takeover
P2Player,,2019-06-06 13:01:00,1.3,ADMP is an easy BO candidate at 300 to 325
Charlie_Buffett,,2019-06-06 13:01:00,1.3,ADMP Stock starting trading back up after Jasons post Is it that thinly traded or is Jason the Cramer of biotech
BowenHardcase,,2019-06-06 12:48:00,1.3,ADMP is down over 70 since partnership deal signed and Sandoz hasnt held up their end of bargain at all hell the silence is literally killing ADMP and Sandoz cant even be bothered to throw them a bone with some fluff PR or anything Carlo signed a bad deal with a bad company

BowenHardcase,,2019-06-06 12:14:00,1.31,ADMP hopefully someone will see discounted SP and potential and do BO at like 37 or 38 and just end the pain and suffering around here
thorba,,2019-06-06 12:13:00,1.31,ADMP In fact the ADMP will need cash over the next 12 months but they will not be able to collect that through the stock market ADMP need an upfront payment from Sandoz or a new distributor for Zimhi And I think that message will hopefully come soon
Gripen1982,,2019-06-06 12:07:00,1.309,ADMP wow down again I dont know what it will take maybe a nail gun to Carlos thick skull But the reality is this is a sad sad sad sad sad company

BowenHardcase,,2019-06-06 10:31:00,1.333,ADMP fact is this would likely be a 15 or even 20 stock under even mediocre leadership And for the record all the shit the naysayers around here point out isnt secondguessing or hindsight there have literally been posters on these very boards calling Carlo out for their screwups and incompetence every step of the way Sad The real question though is can ADMP ever recover Realistically all bearbullshit aside with no active pipeline empty coffers Carlo still at the helm no launch in sight for Symjepi no revenue for at least 23 more Q because of that Zimhi tied up in legal troubles 99 of retails looking to bail million shares out looking to squash any momentum and a pathetic 2year history of going down even on good news can ADMP ever truly recover How can pumpers just blindly ignore all that Are they retarded Selling calls What

BowenHardcase,,2019-06-06 10:09:00,1.335,ADMP honestly even as a detractor Im absolutely shocked at how bad Carlo let things get I simply never imagined it would fall this far and this hard from just simple silence I figured itd take something serious to drop it down here like more dilution or Sandoz dropping out of deal or a manufacturing issue to bring it this low
ElDonJuan,,2019-06-06 09:58:00,1.336,ADMP just happy to see it grey LOL
