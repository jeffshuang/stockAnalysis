arang,,2019-06-06 14:09:00,3.29,CPRX If fundamentals outlooks are great why is this thing keep going down Isnt it suppose to climb up little by little upward slope to fundamental figures Just low volume is the issue

Rantomac,True,2019-06-06 11:58:00,3.26,CPRX needs volume Driving it down or up will create activity All good Should rebound Better than driving it up and selling off Prefer this pattern
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-06 11:50:00,3.23,CPRX I imagine a big buyer will step in at some point Share price is pretty sweet here
arang,,2019-06-06 11:49:00,3.21,CPRX 30 cents drop woot
DadaKondke,True,2019-06-06 11:45:00,3.23,CPRX the dip makes no sense to me The company confirms 306 paid patients and 121 uninsured Even if they dont grow this translates to 117m in revenue and 84m pretax profit Given all Jacobus patients seem to have migrated it is clear that Jacobus is no competition I bought 3k more 326
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-06 11:43:00,3.24,CPRX Yall need to stop yer cryin The shorts know whats up Why do you think theyre driving this down on no news They know that theyre going to have to cover and are creating some room to maneuver If you havent sold then you havent lost any money Quit yer bitchin
tookay,,2019-06-06 11:31:00,3.253,CPRX I understand they have to go to these conferences to promote their company and products but heckthey must know what that is going to do to shareholders when they have nothing new to say and dont address an important ongoing concern which I did not expect them to from a shareholders perspective would be better if they never went
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-06 11:22:00,3.253,CPRX They really need to stop tanking this Im emptying my bank account to buy more shares

dkmadhvn,,2019-06-06 10:51:00,3.3,CPRX Surprised that they did not give a revenue projection at least for the current quarter
arang,,2019-06-06 10:47:00,3.279,CPRX Quick question If Ruzurgi is not an issue and future outlook is great why the Management does not come up with something to make share price go back up to original place Thank you

al64,,2019-06-06 10:36:00,3.295,CPRX Patience I love the dip on no news for a company that all analyst 100 say its a buy I can retire when it goes to capacity
Maccabee,True,2019-06-06 10:36:00,3.295,CPRX Fundamentals and logic does not work at this stage The uncertainty is an opportunity for shorts If you are long it is all about the entry point Each day is different time of day is different before 10 before 11 or after hours It is important to know the pivot point support and resistance First lot at support 1 and second at support 2
TesttheWaters,,2019-06-06 10:34:00,3.298,CPRX Nothing new in the Jefferies presentation from what I can see
keremoner,,2019-06-06 10:29:00,3.263,CPRX wow this is like a guaranteed lottery ticket that you know will hit Not buying it at these levels is beyond comprehension This is simply MMs playing games for now Jacobus is a nonissue if you ask me because 1 They cannot price their drug much under 300K due to the fact that FDA approved it for use with pediatric patients which there are a dozen of only and they owe 60M already in RD and will need another 20M or so for marketing Jacobus cannot assume that drug will be used by adults also Business decisions do not work that way 2 Physicians will not prescribe any other alternatives to Firdapse because a it does not cost but 30 per patient b convenience Firdapse contains amifampridine as the phosphate salt which is more stable than the base drug contained in Ruzurgi and therefore does not require refrigeration and c insurance cos wont take the liability of using Ruzurgi offlabel
