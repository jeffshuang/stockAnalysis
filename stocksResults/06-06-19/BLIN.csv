Nothing100percent,,2019-06-06 15:23:00,2.997,BLIN The StochasticMomentumIndex is at 91 on the Weekly chart Thats the lowest its ever been in its history The second lowest was in Nov of 2018 88 It took a month and a 25 drop with bullish divergence before went up 40 in 2 days Thats just one indicator but it makes you wonder when this is going to spike Im guessing it will spike enough for bag holders to bail in a month if they can hold out for another 25 down The StochasticMomentumIndex is at 67 on the Daily chart and has been bouncing in the oversold area since the end of April Thats the longest it has ever stayed in the oversold area Im ignore everything that happened before the big volume spike in May That volume is exponentially larger than anything in the past Its an IPO Start date May of 2019

TX_Trader1,,2019-06-06 13:52:00,2.96,BLIN I have few questions while trying to understand this market manipulation May be gurus can help me understand 1 if a financial company wanted to exercise their warrants would we retail investors come to know via PR b4 they exercised 2 when stock price jumps how they can be able to exercise quickly meaning their broker first have to contact the issuing company and they have to generate new os shares right it can take some time But many times what I see when it spikes they just dump immediately meaning they have some hidden shares ready go which I couldnt figure that out about warrants exercise mechanism and timeline 3 when they exercise how soon after it reflects on OS count Do we have to wait until they file 10Q is how finviz finds I know its bit much but any insight is much appreciated Thanks
