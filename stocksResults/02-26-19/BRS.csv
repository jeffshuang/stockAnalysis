2PipeProblem,,2019-02-26 12:21:00,1.319,BRS but why are the waiting SO LONG with the 10 Q statement

elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:38:00,1.333,BRS Now I have more shares of BRS than I can count
elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:37:00,1.333,BRS After I said BRS will rock this week I knew these shorts would join issues by selling their last drop of blood So I kept cash LOADED
elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:27:00,1.325,BRS So any reason why these CLUELESS shorts are not filling the 132 bid and coming lower to us LMFAO again and again
elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:15:00,1.333,BRS Im sure some of the idiots selling BRS followed me over to sell IGCC Not sure they can heal the whalloping anytime soon
elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:12:00,1.33,BRS Essentially added 57 between yesterday and today SILENTLY
elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:09:00,1.335,BRS And my shares are not available for borrowing as I have set my sells on them We are not going anywhere on BRS Its not a trade
elonfan,,2019-02-26 11:07:00,1.335,BRS These fools are still struggling with their sells here Great news I ADDED several thousand shares today by the way More later today
Tommy1377,True,2019-02-26 11:03:00,1.337,BRS Still confident of big boost on filing of 10Q Good entry point here
