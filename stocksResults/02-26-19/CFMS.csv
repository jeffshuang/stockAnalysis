Sasha006,True,2019-02-26 10:44:00,1.177,CFMS Just crossing the 90 moving average volume should start to move upSweet
moneytrader2017,,2019-02-26 10:10:00,1.147,CFMS Watch for a quick move down to close the GAP then bounce off quickly Greed fleecing the the retailers
moneytrader2017,,2019-02-26 10:08:00,1.15,CFMS coincidence that once I posted the price stopped dropping When a share price goes up fast it will duplicate the downward move
