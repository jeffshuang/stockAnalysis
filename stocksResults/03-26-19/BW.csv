BearShorter1,True,2019-03-26 12:43:00,0.4358,BW ugh was looking to fill another 5k below 41
theretheygo57,,2019-03-26 12:36:00,0.4364,BW I expected 43 to be hard to crackmaybe not

BearShorter1,True,2019-03-26 10:48:00,0.4211,BW Creeping up to meet at 4229 and 423 I suspect
BearShorter1,True,2019-03-26 10:37:00,0.4251,BW It was a HOD trade retrace down If finishing lower would not have passed it so soon Maker does that to keep out scalps and rebuys
BearShorter1,True,2019-03-26 10:35:00,0.4246,BW Im assuming they will straddle 423 most of the day or be above it That 4200 that sold at 4229 when it sold is telling
BearShorter1,True,2019-03-26 10:33:00,0.4219,BW Looking for a retrace back to low 40s for a rubber band shot on any good news Could be any day this week Definitely accumulation
BearShorter1,True,2019-03-26 10:16:00,0.4257,BW They are slowing it down to test patience It will finish higher than 423 today Not dropping it to let early scalps back in
Entrepredoer,True,2019-03-26 09:55:00,0.4237,BW I like it
