NJDevilsinseven,,2019-03-26 12:10:00,3.07,CHEK I knew I JINXED us as soon as I made my last postOops Looks controlled we are still moving the pile North
ap100,,2019-03-26 10:44:00,3.094,CHEK as expectedshould consolidate between 295 and 325 for a few days pending overall market conditions then a nice break of 330
stocksmaster,,2019-03-26 10:18:00,3.08,CHEK I believe she needs to consolidate but looks like a breakout for longer term what do you think can be the next entry point
NJDevilsinseven,,2019-03-26 09:45:00,3.21,CHEK I like how we rarely dip below the previous days closeanother Green Day for the CHEK crew onward and upward
