bobsizzla,,2019-05-23 11:43:00,20.53,MGM MLCO well see how the rest of day shapes up but if this is 1st inning of the long march then Gonna need a lot more pain than this before Trump sends Preplanned tweet announcing surrender I mean victory to end to his fake preplanned trade war and finally retreat as planned from his fake bluster So time will tell whether the aggressive buying back of stock into the weakness this morning Will prove a good idea it worked for MLcO last year when they drew the line at 1750 and might work for Muren here at 25 but might be a little too early to be aggressively buying back stock
