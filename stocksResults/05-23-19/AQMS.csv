giuseppeventuri,,2019-05-23 15:32:00,1.81,AQMS And we have a gap up to fill too
giuseppeventuri,,2019-05-23 15:30:00,1.81,AQMS Market is recovering from lows
giuseppeventuri,True,2019-05-23 15:13:00,1.809,AQMS In other words after a long due diligence and working directly on this process Veolia knows about Aquarefining much more than any market investor If its not possibile to achieve success with Aquarefining why does Veolia work on it payed only in shares Could anyone answer this And if Aquarefining process is achievable with success and profit how much will AMQS shares value The current quotation
giuseppeventuri,True,2019-05-23 14:55:00,1.802,AQMS Anyway market underestimate the fact management is payed in big part with shares and Veolia engaged itself after a long due diligence as we know accepted to be payed in shares too This bodes well for what they see in Aquarefining process
Gazza_G,True,2019-05-23 13:59:00,1.84,AQMS Heres my prediction wish This thing soars in AH trading due to PR on Clarios andor 58 Mod news just prior to Investor presentation Deep pockets tutes then jump onboard tomorrow and cause Shorts to cover 4M shares hastilySP is at 10 come Monday
Frontlineinv,,2019-05-23 13:58:00,1.84,AQMS much as Id like to see a detailed timeline of modules rollout contract and production targets for the rest of year it would expose management and company to unnecessary legal risk So therefore we wait
Topolino,,2019-05-23 13:43:00,1.84,AQMS AFH DF yet sometimes even shit bounces
michael82929,,2019-05-23 12:13:00,1.823,AQMS once this company starts generating no one will remember moments in time like this
Scalper123,,2019-05-23 12:00:00,1.84,AQMS someones throwing somewhat sizeable walls on the ask may be a hood on this today I guess we wait to see what this presentation brings
fergy,,2019-05-23 10:54:00,1.833,AQMS what a joke I hope Veolia buys them out Cotton is a joke No skills no game type of guy Just plain garbage
ALLinCLEVELAND,True,2019-05-23 10:48:00,1.83,AQMS I believe the presentation today will help a lot moving forward as only institutes and funds with deep pockets will be attending
giuseppeventuri,,2019-05-23 10:02:00,1.84,AQMS After all Cotton was right It was good to raise capital so whatever happens to markets weve now sufficient capital to finalize in peace our revolutionary process development commercialization
santa27,,2019-05-23 09:46:00,1.82,AQMS veolia should just buy this out at this price
Topolino,True,2019-05-23 09:45:00,1.8,AQMS capitalization is crazy now only 97MJokes
