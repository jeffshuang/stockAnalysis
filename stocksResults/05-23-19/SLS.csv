Jennx6,True,2019-05-23 14:59:00,0.7916,SLS Personally I think breakthrough therapy is a given and the more I read about accelerated approval regulatory requirements the more I think THAT is a real possibility The company knew last July it only had a oneyear cash runway going for them And this was after phase 2B interim results demonstrated they didnt need to continue I have to believe that Dr Stergios would never have merged with Galena just to see his company fail in less than 2 years The entire BOD SAB and management team are all accomplished professionals there must be some dealmaking based on contingencies going on in the background Also Jacob Gottlieb has 28M in stockwarrants and he bought in initially based on GPS potential Im VERY nervous given the timing not gonna lie but confident in what I bought The potential is worth more than 1520M MC
