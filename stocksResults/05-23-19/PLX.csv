BasketCase,,2019-05-23 14:12:00,0.4083,PLX Moshe gone I feel it is necessary to say some words Pappa Moshe was a good man he set out many years ago to change this world one plant cell at a time During his journey there were good times and bad I still remember how Moshe would giggle like a school girl everytime he asked Yossi to try and say Pegunigalsidase He could never say it right Always came out like Foff That Yossi Bad times were many though Never invited me to any company outings even though I made sure he got up every morning by breathing on his bedroom window till he woke up Oh and that time he got caught humping a petri dish he claimed he was looking for his cell phone but we all know how plant based therapy really turned him onHe will be missed
