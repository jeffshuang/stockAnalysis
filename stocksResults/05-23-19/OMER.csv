ph7007,,2019-05-23 14:35:00,19.27,OMER Last October the market wrote off igan 2nd cohort p2 data the stock price crashed from 25 to as low as 10The recent stock price recovery was largely due to omidria This coming Junes igan p2 detailed data may boost stock priceThe data may convince the market it was very good one and could indicate that igan p3 will succeed TMA endpoints news and possible new data release and possible BLA submission will give another huge stock price boost Dont forget it can be rollingASM can also give some more hints about what good things are happening at OmerosI love the month of June
BioBomber,True,2019-05-23 12:23:00,19.146,OMER If you bought OMER 1 year ago you would be down 2 That is an amazing job by someone to keep the share price down while the company grows so much stronger How much longer can they keep it down hopefully we know the answer in the next couple months I think Greg has a huge summer planned for OMERica
siteobserver,,2019-05-23 12:23:00,19.146,OMER I sold OMER at 1940 since it keeps bouncing off 1950 and has trouble punching thru 20 I am holding call options for the BLA next ER and I DO plan to buy back stock under 19
