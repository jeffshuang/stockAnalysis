jerryg7777,,2019-05-23 14:35:00,8.785,AAOI a different kind of option if youre bullish on this Sell the dec 750 puts for a buck something and buy the 10 calls for a bit more than a buck and change aka a cash secured bull reversalIf the stock goes below 750 youll get put it but your break even is about 640 maybe Hey Id rather buy this at 640 than near 9 If the stock rips past 10 you have a whopping maybe 20 per 100 share cost basis net and you can make an absolute fortune if it rips to 10 or 20 by then Way better idea than just buying here at retail price hoping it goes up If youre bullish this is more of a no brainer than just buying it You can always buy the 5 put if you dont have the margin or dont want to tie up more of your working capital
