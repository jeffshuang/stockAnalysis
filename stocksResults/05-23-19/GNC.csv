kmichell,,2019-05-23 15:47:00,1.518,GNC I remember when my uncle bought a gnc store and thought that would be the end of his days as a pharmacist it was right next to a planet fitness and things were looking fine and dandy at first until the former owner opened a vitamin shoppe across the street lol my other gnc story is I used to buy preworkout from costco 2 tubs for 2030 cant remember specifically great deal though anyways went into GNC and it was 35 for one tub without membership and then 30 with membership never went back again with those prices gnc baffles me what even is their business model how do they think theyre providing value whatsoever
