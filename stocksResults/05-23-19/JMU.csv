LKS1234,,2019-05-23 12:48:00,1.387,JMU how to value a crypto tech co This is not mining bitcoins Any similar crypto tech co out there
LKS1234,,2019-05-23 12:47:00,1.387,JMU this is now a crpyto tech co with a growing food catering b2b biz
LKS1234,,2019-05-23 12:45:00,1.387,JMU anyone wonder why majority owner was able to buy into first 25 of the co at 10 per ADSs Maybe because he had the crpyto tech co to sell to the co with his stake up to almost 50
LKS1234,,2019-05-23 10:45:00,1.409,JMU but I got it right in the total outstanding 11 million ADSs after co acquired crypto tech co ADSs now tightly held unless the majority owner sold or wishes to sell now

LKS1234,,2019-05-23 10:25:00,1.427,JMU I guess he would not mind paying 10 just to buy out the co but obviously he wants to keep the co listed and he intends to make the co successful
LKS1234,,2019-05-23 10:20:00,1.387,JMU even if the crypto tech co is valued at nothing by market that means he was paying 495 per ADSs

LKS1234,,2019-05-23 10:17:00,1.387,JMU why was he paying so much for the first 25 ownership and also sold his crypto tech to the company to get his ownership to close to 50 of the company
