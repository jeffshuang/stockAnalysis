Dirtymartini66,,2019-05-23 12:31:00,2.085,XXII Its about one of the countries stopped waiting for the USFDA to do the right thing and got out in front and went after big tobacco maybe this will give the EU andor Asian countries a nudge in the right direction to move forward on VLN BEFORE the US maybe thatll apply the necessary pressure on our FDA because the health and mortality rate of US citizenry sure isnt

robtheo1420,,2019-05-23 11:15:00,2.049,XXII i might not be great at understanding and reading charts but i can read a financial sheet and see that this company is progressing just fine YoY even if it is still in the red from what i understand we spent 10 mill on submitting apps to FDA thats almost half of our negative EBITDA from last year so i expect our EPS to grow this year to somewhere between 02 and 00 and possibly a positive EPS the following year
robtheo1420,,2019-05-23 11:07:00,2.055,XXII the company has been growing revenue while cutting losses the last five years EPS has been cut from 26 EPS 5 years ago to 06 EPS just last year and now that the apps have been submitted to FDA we should be able to move in a positive EPS over the next 2 years even if the anprm does get drawn out by the FDA and BT for a few years as many have said this has always been a long term play

Congostockchat,True,2019-05-23 10:46:00,2.057,XXII by the way folks I am going to add just one other small comment today BIG TOBACCO with their new iqos nicotine easy bake oven addiction contraption machine in the country of Japan where apparently it is a pretty mature product has apparently gained about a 10 market share And so lets do some simple math here Vln which is being talked about as gaining 1 market share put that in my own survey Im finding 80 interest in from smokers versus the new big tobacco throat slitting vaporizing exploding device if its anything like some ecigs have been gaining about a 10 market share Welcome to the NEW BIG TOBACCO CO XXII
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-23 10:39:00,2.055,XXII folks Im going to keep my comments brief today but I do just want to say one thing We have heard a lot about XXII vln taking 1 market share You know what is funny about that though I have talked to a lot of smokers since being in this stock I was hugely addicted myself for three decades And I will tell you that out of the 100 or more smokers I have spoken with 80 of them expressed what I would call very significant interest in this product LOL Folks That would not be 1 market share That would be a 80 market share have a nice day Prepare for approval
