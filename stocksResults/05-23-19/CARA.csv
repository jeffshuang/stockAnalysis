mrmark4729,True,2019-05-23 11:31:00,18.795,CARA But you really have no right to complain unless you are a farmer who plants soybeans as an example I have a friend who plants over 1000 acres of soybeans here in Wisconsin and he actually loses money by planting So then the government says they will step in and subsidize the farmers and then at that point futures go down even greater Still had his crop from last year but finally said screw it and sold it for a much greater loss But now he cant plant because the ground is so wet from the rains and doesnt know if you will get his crop in He is making sure that his 3 kids go to college so they can get the hell out of the farming business which has been in the family for150 years and not have to struggle And our government officials especially the man on top makes it even worse He hasnt driven himself to work in over 50 years and let alone drive a tractor like these guys And the farmers support this guy and he is the 1st one to stab them in the back
mrmark4729,True,2019-05-23 11:04:00,18.653,CARA Once again we are at the mercy of our dysfunctional government especially the man on top
