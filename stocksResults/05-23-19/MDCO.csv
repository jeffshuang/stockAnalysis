sell1buy2,True,2019-05-23 10:48:00,32.935,MDCO Alex Denner spent 15 mil buying shares on Mon Tues and Weds this week between 33133450trading at 3295 wonder what hes doing today no idea whether hes buying but it certainly makes sense and should be trading 20 higher than it is right nowpatience patience patienceit will be rewarded
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-23 10:01:00,33.013,MDCO trading lower despite great news since beginning of the week AND the SMART money has been buying while the Short Mafia Dumb money continues to manipulate shares and short the stock I would not be surprised to see this trading 200 of more in a buyout scenario within next 6 mos not a typo 200 OR moremy personal opinion
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-23 09:38:00,32.989,MDCO why has there been HUGE insider buying over past 67 mos activist investor Alex Denner Sarissa Cap is not only on the board he is the chairman and bought 430k more shares over past 3 days while shorts pushed it lower despite REALLY good datanews Inclisiran is likely to wind up being a blockbuster drug the data thus far has been amazingly good and clean but dont trust me just look at the analysts comments Ive posted over past few days Denner has amassed more than 4 mil shs not incl 50 mil in converts why BC he is on a mission to get this product approved and the company SOLD at a hefty price Analysts have mentioned this as a buyout candidate repeatedly SB trading at 3840 today if not for short mafia games
