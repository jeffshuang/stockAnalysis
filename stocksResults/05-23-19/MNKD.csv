hllydlly306,True,2019-05-23 15:42:00,1.217,MNKD Careful where you go to get reliable information Start with a wealth advisor financial planner or actuary to determine if you are diversified enough to add some speculative action in your portfolio If so consider MNKD as a long term speculative position with only a few dollars downside risk and huge upside potential over the long term While some stocks have little revenue they are valued on other metrics until their full potential plays out which can take years and in some cases decades because of the evolution of technology and science You must be willing to stomach the ups and downs of the market due to external forces Next some people prefer to look at the past of a stocks performance to generate dialogue on social media forums A stocks past performance is not an indicator of the future performance That is in every Prospectus
