Amartin007,,2019-05-23 10:48:00,0.961,SMRT Trades under IYC if you guys check that ETF out it will provide some insight to the direction of SMRT I am unsure of the exact number of shares that ETF holds to diversify investor profiles to the extent of effectiveness SMRTs trend but it is worth noting and keeping an eye on IYC also follow the bulk of the overall market trend so def worth noting All connected
Godblessyou,True,2019-05-23 10:45:00,0.9566,SMRT Anyone thinking that going all in would be a bad idea
Amartin007,,2019-05-23 10:38:00,0.9551,SMRT The market has some figuring out to do this particular stock is the same as filling up a Helium balloon letting go and watching it fall to the ground Not possible unless atmospheric changeswhich is what we see here in the market Wait for the atmosphere to change and it shall rise
Rolltidetrader,,2019-05-23 10:35:00,0.9593,SMRT wouldnt take much to squeeze given restrictions todaytomorrow Markets red lots of money floating around little resistance above and lots of shorts who havent covered from plunge Can it get some buyers Back to being cheapoversoldunder valued

letsseewhathappens,True,2019-05-23 10:14:00,0.9639,SMRT wow its getting a little bit ridiculous now
Jaredmc34,,2019-05-23 10:06:00,0.9847,SMRT wow at least everything is in the toilet today
Amartin007,,2019-05-23 10:02:00,0.99,SMRT This is merely an opinion of mine based on observation so I am open for criticism here SMRT is trading under IYC which is a longterm investment ETF hence larger positions for investors who trade conservativewith its several day red chart only makes sense SMRT is taking a hit for this with that said once IYC is done being put through the ringer will open opportunity for larger positions to re enter making SMRT recover as well as trigger radars and welcome more day traders with a strong bullish trend Note Overall Market teetering which IYC is effected by as well So SMRT is being brutally beat due to all of these factors despite the sound company financials etc already stated all of that so I am thinking this although in disguise as a penny stock has great potential once global factors are worked through and the US economy makes a bullish recovery will have an macro effect here as well
letsseewhathappens,True,2019-05-23 10:01:00,0.9819,SMRT holy moly what on earth is going on lets not go to sleep here

Rolltidetrader,,2019-05-23 09:57:00,1.008,SMRT heres an idea Its under a short restriction today how about using that and walking the price higher instead of selling at the bid That might be asking too much as The only people who seem to know how to trade is shorts

Rolltidetrader,,2019-05-23 09:36:00,1.039,SMRT was counting on a pull back after crazy jump up but this is over done No reason for it to be trading less today then it was going into ER Short selling restriction trigger should help
