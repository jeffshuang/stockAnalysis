jonj711,True,2019-05-23 15:59:00,2.236,NBRV Fast response from email sentWas worried of 60 new sales hires and when they would be put on payroll Was hoping not until after approval and not now for training which would effect cash burn The reps will be made offers contingent upon approval of lefamulin The will most likely start at Nabriva 23 weeks later some sooner and some later depending on their existing job situation We have built their hires into our forecast which we recently reconfirmed as us having enough cash to get into Q2 2020 DaveVP Corporate Controller Head of IRNabriva Therapeutics plc

jonj711,True,2019-05-23 11:50:00,2.29,NBRV Just in a period of no news expected for a couple of weeks thats getting manipulated right now but we have a CC on the 6th with many possibilities of something good coming out of it NBRV has a PDUFA in August for Lefamulin and soon to be scheduled Type A with the FDA to discuss manufacturing issues for Contepo which has been stated by the company not to be fundamental issues but addressable issues which leaves me to believe an easy fix The factory is in Europe and passed previous inspections for Canada and Europe I believe NBRV also submitted an MAA just this month for Lefamulin If anyone would like to add more substance backing that sentence please do
