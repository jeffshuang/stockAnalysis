hubertyear,,2019-05-23 14:15:00,2.24,UXIN not saying whos right but shorts covered some today and bought lots of panic sell from longs
Inspirational332,False,2019-05-23 14:12:00,2.25,UXIN Slowly but surely longs are bailing out some realize that are just losing way too much money on Chinese Junk Why would anyone BUY and NOT Short Craigslist of China I guess longs love losing money Like I told you before Trading range is 150 300 until ER then it will crash below that afterwards They are burning through WAY too much cash on advertising and STILL wont be profitable

Cory1978,True,2019-05-23 12:47:00,2.248,UXIN looks to me like a simple short attack by the chart Without much panic selling A good Omen IMO Hurts a bit to see a price below my average and hold yet Im not worried as it seems pretty much noone else is either The shorts will loose interest as soon as they realize the wont scare enough people to make any money Better days soon to come Cant blame the shorts they played low for a day or two Now just testing peoples resolve again

oneshotstevie,True,2019-05-23 10:44:00,2.194,UXIN Im still in this but I did lower my position a little because I had too high of a percentage of my life savings in it but Im still bullish I will keep researching this company
hubertyear,,2019-05-23 10:20:00,2.229,UXIN all these are noice SP is volatile especially under the tradewar headwinds The rule of thumb is to buy any dip bigger than 5 depending on how long you hold For longs if you truly believe uxin is a scam or the Tradewar will escalade to physical war over Taiwan or a recession is coming soon or you are heavy on margin youd better sell now Otherwise relax and hold for 6 months to two years you will enjoy the reward Uxin is not a bad place to park your money in stocks at this price
