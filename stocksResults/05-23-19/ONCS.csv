paxamericana30,,2019-05-23 12:02:00,2.65,ONCS for those bagholding with high averages There is hope but it is contingent on PISCES working out and this getting an approval late next year or early next Assuming full dilution to 16 million OS If you have a pre split average of 101 pre split 160 million MC gets you to even 1515 pre split 240 million MC gets you to even 20 2 pre split and 320 million MC gets you to even 25or 25 pre split and 400 million gets you to even These Market caps are certainly achievable assuming PISCES is successful and this gets approved in Melanoma late next year or early 21 500 million is the low end I think this should be valued at if they are successful in Melanoma The PD1 refractory market for melanoma in the US alone is estimated at 416 million This doesnt even factor in any other value from TNBC Cervical or the European Marketetc GLTA
