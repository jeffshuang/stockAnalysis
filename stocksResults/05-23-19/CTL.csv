marble,True,2019-05-23 15:59:00,9.658,CTL there are 159 large caps with a dividend yield of more than 1 and gross margin of over 50 Of these 159 companies CenturyLink ranks 11th with PFCF of 889 and 7th with Fwd PE of 773Some might point to the Current Ratio of 07 but thats really only because of the recent write offs due to continued stock decline and NOT a fundamental deficiency I think at this point its pretty clear a buyback will be the quickest way to restore shareholder value but it seems the board prefers to wait it out with the more prudent approach of paying down debt I will also wait it out and continue to average down Thank you shorts
