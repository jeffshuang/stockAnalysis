Tazthedevil,True,2019-05-23 14:24:00,1.5,SNES Why do I believe they are warrant conversions Well this is the 30 price marker for warrant execution If I were a large investor buying up the warrants during the initial offering or even better an original warrant holder this is between 30 and 90 gain Liquidating for gains while supported by buyers with powder to burn Pretty simple play if you ask me Also this is yet another nice support area and a good spot to build a new position for another run up The corner is upon us Just a matter of time before we turn it and move on to greener pastures I did get 3 lots today Everyone should recognize that the significance of warrant execution is that it feeds the companys bottom line Cash in hand
