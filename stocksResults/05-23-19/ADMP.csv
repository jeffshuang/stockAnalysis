BowenHardcase,,2019-05-23 14:54:00,1.505,ADMP i understand where longs are coming from i see the potential upside ADMP has a lot of good things on the horizon that can really push a stock like this and make a run stuff like Symjepi launch coming international launch Zimhi approval deal launch I get it guys I really do But you gotta weigh darkside stuff too Theyre low on cash and lawsuit feels unexpected so promises to hopefully not dilute this year dont mean as much anymore And they completely killed their pipeline to make ends meet while Carlo and BoD get bonuses I dont like that at all Also Symjepi launch is somehow still in question How is that possible Deal was signed 10 months ago ffs Is Sandoz incompetent or just uninterested Because I dont care how spectacular your launch is if it takes this long to get there Opportunity costs have piled up from these delays and I dont think Sandoz is doing their job 12
URMessinUp,,2019-05-23 14:35:00,1.505,ADMP THIS VOLUME IS TERRIBLE EVEN AT THESE PRICES NO BUYERS IF ADMP HAS TO DILUTE OR CONTINUES TO NOT SELL ANYTHING SPELLS DISASTER AHEAD SOON SCAMSHIT

wjgesq,,2019-05-23 11:01:00,1.57,ADMP I have said for quite a long time that ADMP requires a miracle of biblical proportions to put it mildlyjust to get even near FDA preapproval levels The damage done by management and the partner has been so deep and so intense that it is hard to conceive of any circumstances under which this company would thrive And even surviving will only be at our expense as the dilutionsofferings and reverse splits will be necessary for each next breath So difficult to imagine why it had to be this way ADMP will likely end up being the subject of various MBA thesis and that is probably about it

BowenHardcase,,2019-05-23 10:11:00,1.59,ADMP sorry longs its over now The potential for a homerun was certainly there but Carlo couldnt deliver Even a 100 run on launch news would barely get this back to Feb levels and thats really sad because there is no way this runs 100 on anything short of BO So with million shares out ready to squash any run every retail SH wanting to bail and not even at a profit just looking to escape less red any pop on launch news will be shortlived quite unimpressive And then it will bleed right back down to these levels again before doing the same dance on next catalyst whether thats good newson Zimhi or sales from Symjepi And thats like the BEST CASE scenario for longs Carlo could still screw things up with bad Zimhi deal or long drawn out PSlaunch timeline like wSymjepi more dilution because out of cash or Sandoz might continue to be awful partner wlaunch delays or kaléo suit for Zimhi has more merit than all the armchair experts here seem to think
jeffs92,,2019-05-23 10:07:00,1.595,ADMP beachsidefreddy blocked me for saying this and only this All he does is pump with no facts and no track record Any investor worth his or her weight in salt knows that both debt and offerings in the situation that admp is in could be big trouble Be careful I lost a good sum in SGYP and lost a little in ADMP before I sold in the 4s Im not bashing it but warning
