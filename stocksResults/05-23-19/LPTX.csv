Radcon2017,True,2019-05-23 10:43:00,1.53,LPTX One other noteCrude Oil has collapsedcould very well be a harbinger of things to comeEconomy could possibly be in for a rough ride in the second half of 2019Here is the crude chartMy main concern here is what kind of environment will LPTX be releasing data intoAgain it is good to get this market selloff under our belts nowWith China Iran market concerns etc this should hopefully result in the Fed keeping rates from rising for awhile in my opinionAll in all we are in a low rate rate environment still in a strong bull marketI expect the Indexes to snap back later this year hopefully Again just my opinion
