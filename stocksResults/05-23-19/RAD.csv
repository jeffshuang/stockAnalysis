Powerbunch1,,2019-05-23 10:02:00,7.75,RAD A more logical valuation would be to assume that the PBM is still worth 2B at least for the reasons weve already cited Dont forget a much larger PBM with infrastructure already in place could acquire EnvisionRX and immediately cut all of the SGA that Rite Aid has added over the years without sacrificing growth Additionally the SGA infrastructure buildout for EnvisionRX is complete adjusted EBITDA should grow significantly from current levels At 15 a script a value almost certainly below what Freds obtained the scripts value is 26B Now we are at 46B in offbalance sheet assets Well add 500M back to the balance sheet and put the deficit at 2B instead of 25B which is more than fair given that we were previously adding nonexistent liabilities This puts Rite Aids value at 26B which is still conservative but much more realistic As a share price it would equate to 4828 per share which is over 500 higher than the current stock price
