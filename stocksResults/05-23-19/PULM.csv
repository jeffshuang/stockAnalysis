AdventureDavid212,True,2019-05-23 15:19:00,1.04,PULM all this bla bla bla this that this its bullish or what Im in too
UglyAmerican,True,2019-05-23 15:13:00,1.052,PULM There is no way the company will go for less than 500 million Its far more likely to go for between 800 million to 1 billion Even at the low end projection therefore and allowing for a small amount of forward dilution a buyout would likely price the company at a 10 times multiple to its current capitalization and PPS

bwhipple,,2019-05-23 14:53:00,1.05,PULM So the maximum duration of the study for any one patient is 38 days There are plenty of patients Say the trial takes two months to enroll and is complete for all patients within four months from now Thats end of September Evaluation and review what two more months IDK but final data seems closer the end of 2019 to me And PUR1900 is priority review right

ComicManLuke,True,2019-05-23 14:24:00,1.05,PULM compared to the rest of the market this is doing fairly well holding strong at this level
je0922,,2019-05-23 14:22:00,1.05,PULM Line in sand is very clear
CashBull_415,,2019-05-23 14:13:00,1.04,PULM I am thinking of buying in whats the catalysts
rezin8,,2019-05-23 13:33:00,1.04,PULM so according to the confidentiality agreement back in November 2018 we now know that had to do with this agreement with Cipla in April 2019 Is it strange that not much over a month later in December 2018 Pulm and Vectura conveniently decided to mutually end the partnership on pur0200 Hmm enquiring minds want to know Anyone have any ideas
Preye089,,2019-05-23 13:32:00,1.04,PULM How long have some of you held this stock in anticipation of news that would make it jump
SovereignMystic,True,2019-05-23 13:26:00,1.04,PULM Primed and ready Hoping tomorrow we get some PR
vsland,True,2019-05-23 12:54:00,1.04,PULM The preparation of an important move in the market takes a considerable time A large operator or investor acting singly cannot often in a single days session buy 25000 to 100000 shares of stock without putting the price up too much Instead he takes days weeks or months in which to accumulate his line in one or many stocks

saulrabba,True,2019-05-23 12:13:00,1.04,PULM so quite MMs are like professional fishermen with fishing net and small boat Trying to get whatever for the day mealGood news soon
UglyAmerican,,2019-05-23 12:12:00,1.04,PULM Another reason Pulmatrix is difficult to value is because it targets unmet needs This means there are not many comparable drugs on the market This makes it hard to value drug candidates but gives Pulmatrix significant pricing power The flexibility of Pulmatrix due to their iSPERSE technology also makes their valuation confusing They can license drugs from other companies so their pipeline may be much larger in the future

UglyAmerican,,2019-05-23 11:40:00,1.044,PULM One characteristic that is unique about Pulmatrix is that there are multiple catalysts and they are independent of each other Many biopharmaceutical companies have a value that hinges on the success of one or two drugs Pulmatrix currently has 45 products in development
resonate23,,2019-05-23 11:27:00,1.04,PULM either this one makes me so insane profit or I stop trading indefinitely
