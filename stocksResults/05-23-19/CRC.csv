CanAm2,,2019-05-23 10:50:00,18.072,CRC For the first and second quarters of 2020 CRC has protected the downside risk of approximately 25000 and 15000 barrels per day at approximately 72 Brent and 70 Brent respectively CRCs 2019 and 2020 put spreads provide downside price protection until Brent prices drop to between 55 and 60 per barrel at which point we receive Brent plus approximately 15 per barrel See Attachment 7 for more details
CanAm2,,2019-05-23 10:50:00,18.072,CRC CRC is pegged to BRENT not WTI Currently a 10 spread and they have approx 50 production hedging While I dont think that a drop in oil prices is good for any oil and gas company they are hedged better than most 1st Quarter 2019 Hedging UpdateCRC continues to implement an opportunistic hedging program to protect its cash flow operating margins and capital program while maintaining adequate liquidity For the second quarter of 2019 CRC has protected its downside price risk on approximately 40000 barrels per day at approximately 70 Brent For the third and fourth quarters of 2019 CRC has protected the downside price risk on approximately 40000 and 35000 barrels per day at approximately 73 Brent and 76 Brent respectively The underlying instruments in our 2019 hedge program are puts and put spreads that provide full upside to oil price movements
