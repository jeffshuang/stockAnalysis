TraderMRW,,2019-05-23 09:33:00,0.6201,PIXY I like this company from an operations revenue growth potential etc However I cant buy it because of convertible debt According to registration statement the floor conversion price is 31 The holders will probably keep shorting against the converts until it gets near that price IMO So I will consider it in the 30s Any thoughts or contrary opinions
