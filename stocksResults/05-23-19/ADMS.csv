EndUser,,2019-05-23 12:03:00,5,ADMS Its rare I stumble upon a board such as this one Very rarely do you find a situation where a stock is decimated like this and longs not just continue to support those responsible but praise them for how good a job they have done IMO the CEO CFO with a portion of the board needs to go
Quagglerock,,2019-05-23 11:33:00,5.01,ADMS So painful its almost funny 137m market cap for a company with 190m of cash on hand 60m in annual revenue from a new and growing drug a new MS indication on deck with odds of success at least 50 and an entire time bio set of IP What a clusterfuck
