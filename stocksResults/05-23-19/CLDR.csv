NewTrader10,,2019-05-23 10:49:00,9.996,CLDR I read about that Wells Fargo analyst he has 74 success rate I think he is following this strategy he started CLDR at outperform in Jan with PT 20 when stock was at 125 now he downgraded it to Market perform with PT 125 when stock is at 107 if CLDR is above 125 after a year his success rate would be 100 and if CLDR goes down he will be 50 correct this way he can maintain 75 success rate mostly he starts at outperform and during downgrades changes it to market perform which is still bullish in a bullish market
