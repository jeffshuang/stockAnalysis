HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-23 15:41:00,10.51,OSTK I think its a gift at this price and shorts really have nothing to hang there hat on Yes they can tell you its going to zero and so on but in regards to real argument
Stocktradomous,True,2019-05-23 15:39:00,10.542,OSTK get longgggg
HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-23 15:38:00,10.533,OSTK The stock sale thing was unnecessary in regards to his reaction who cares if it was a margin call or selling to fund his projects I get it he was pissed But his response was way out of line for a CEO who answers to shareholders EGO now you take an EGO like this and short sellers who love to target him because of his EGO and you get here to this price At this price its a gift I think every stupid EGO thing he could do has been priced in and if something goes right we could fly
HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-23 15:36:00,10.49,OSTK justheretomakemoney you want to have serious conversation on OSTK Okay its at 1000 dollars because we have a CEO who is very smart alos has an EGO that is off the charts and has cost share holders billions of dollars He could have made a deal in the USA on TZERO but received a value from SunnyWoo that was much higher However a value on something that dose not close is meaningless You dont have to look to far to know that SunnyWoo is not to be trusted and people told him this but EGO He could have sold retail a long time ago but thought its value was worth more and looked at Wayfair and thought that OSTK should get the same valuation and could grow customers and lose money like Wayfair and get a higher value EGO After all of this he finally got the message and fixed retail
Stocktradomous,True,2019-05-23 15:05:00,10.403,OSTK entering a long here
JustHereToMakeSomeMoney,,2019-05-23 14:58:00,10.375,OSTK alright I hate to be the voice of reason I get the bullish sentiment I have it too More so for tzero than any of the other Mvs I believe Long term gains will be realized but its crazy to overlook the fact that there is constant selling here no buyers and shorts clearly arent covering yet Hence the 10 sp Can anyone explain why
Stuckonearth,,2019-05-23 14:50:00,10.415,OSTK You know who needs block chain more than any other industry is the cannabis industry my friend who works in Arizona sent me this picture and this is how they still have to dealBlock chain with solve that problem and you know in Arizona with the cartels you dont Really want to be driving around with 500000 in your car
HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-23 14:46:00,10.447,OSTK at 10 dollars you get the real estate in UTAH The retail side is a added bonus for free and the block chain stuff is a lotto ticket with much better odds
HUMBLEANDHAPPY,,2019-05-23 14:45:00,10.443,OSTK Its good news but the shorts are unhappy with it because it did not give a dollar amount in revenue However the proof of concept is huge and the USA has a bunch of court houses all on different systems some recorded on paper but very fragmented You ever do a title search to buy real estate and buy title insurance this will change that for ever The shorts to dumb to see the big pic Not saying OSTK will be the winner bu this concept is very very big and show me somebody else in this market already proving concept
Stuckonearth,True,2019-05-23 14:41:00,10.42,OSTK Im so glad that overstock does not follow the big coin anymore weve moved past that However if youre a block chain person I would say this is a better play then IBM

bencahan,,2019-05-23 12:56:00,10.362,OSTK Tough to justify averaging down when the stock is on a two hour freefall
