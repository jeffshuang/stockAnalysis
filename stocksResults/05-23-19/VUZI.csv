herbscore,,2019-05-23 15:18:00,2.399,VUZI the echo chamber here is amazing from a complete misread of competitive device specs to BO hype to folks cheering that were hanging tough at 250 got to be running low on KoolAid
1st2Mkt,True,2019-05-23 14:55:00,2.38,VUZI I just wanted to say that I am proud of us longs today I have read some good and reasoned opinions as to why the future of this company has great potential As this thing hits 20 30 I hope to get to meet some of you at next summers shareholder meeting Unless we sell first of course AR VZX 2019
NinoBrownCMB,,2019-05-23 14:26:00,2.382,VUZI where are all the buy below 180 guys that were around prior to the last CC Wheres all that energy gone Wheres the confidence Their best efforts have us flat at best
joodles33,,2019-05-23 13:30:00,2.39,VUZI Contacted Ed McCregor this is his response It remains quite frustrating for all on every level Frustrating for us as we see so much happening here in terms of business development while watching out stock price trade at its lows Frustrating for everyone else on your side because proof of our success has been slow to come and big money has been lost as the shorts and manipulators have largely had their way with us The tide should swing with a vengeance over the balance of this year We strongly expect this to happen based on what we see today and how we expect things to unfold in terms of news and numbers Attached are the key remarks we made on our 1Q19 conference call Many powerful remarks and expectations therein that should become strong proof points for a revaluation of our stock price before year end Best Ed I think a little more patience no matter how hard will pay off big time for all Adaptation to AR tech is on the verge of mainstream IMHO Show More
growacet,False,2019-05-23 13:08:00,2.401,VUZI Kopin Mcap is almost 90 million 20 million more than Vuzixs which isnt even 70 million

9CrazyFingers,,2019-05-23 12:59:00,2.39,VUZI No volume so nobody is selling Margin calls are done Just think one big order or one good investor And think ML had 6B MC And think some more VZ wants to partner with VUZI
9CrazyFingers,,2019-05-23 12:51:00,2.399,VUZI dont forget 87 naked shares shorted yesterday and we closed green Who does this at multi year lows when the short volume is at all time highs Either a desperate lunatic that needs shares to cover or a genius The fact that this is the first inning of a technology shift I call them lunatics The lunatic is on the grass Hehehe

jemand,,2019-05-23 12:11:00,2.4,VUZI Let the Shorts Play At the Moment no reason for rising but end of the year they can troll i am happy good price to buy
growacet,,2019-05-23 12:08:00,2.4,VUZI Can Vuzix even develop a new product to compete with Google with only 10 million left in the bank And that was as of March 31stin my eyes vuzix is in critical condition that only a major cash infusion can cure

M000,True,2019-05-23 11:08:00,2.38,VUZI This AR space is realWe have seen this all before cellular CSCO network switches software internet etc etc etc shorts trying to profit off propaganda hitting early stage companiesEventually many of these AR companies will start to go publicWhat do you think pps of the first currently only real pure AR playVUZIX will be doing when that starts as one of the top tier leaders in AR hardware and optics tech AAPL is likely going to be a buyer Soaring pps
shabbirk,True,2019-05-23 10:58:00,2.37,VUZI These idiots from Vincent did a hit piece in February as well There points are useless and they are doing this since they are short and trying to make people scared They want to cover and are stuck without a raise 87 naked shorts yesterday They are in panic mode Hang tough we longs will have our fun soon
M000,True,2019-05-23 10:58:00,2.37,VUZI It does not matter what GOOG has released with their new glasses They are just 1 of a few players in the Ocean sized Enterprise space Their glasses still have limitations and issues Vuzix M400 will be tops There is immense room for everyone to do fabulous PLUS VIP partners and solution providers package these products No one is buying these as one off items They are mostly part of solutionsIf anything another this new device released by GOOG and MSFT means the space is more and more valid in fact its heating up
michael82929,True,2019-05-23 10:57:00,2.39,VUZI buffetts says it best I love short sellers their guaranteed buyers at some point
M000,True,2019-05-23 10:53:00,2.39,VUZI DIGILENS raised 50M and Focals Raised 40MHmmSo you will have to assume a 2530 stake of dilutionSo that values these 2 companies at roughly 150m 120m respectivelyFACT Neither of these companies have the tech or product lineup that VUZIX does In fact One has 1 light tech product not doing very well and the other doesnt really have a product only prototypes Private has still been pouring into AR They see what is happening Do you see the gross undervalued state of the only pure public AR play in Vuzix No brainer and incredible value play at this level if you are new to the space
cthompson,True,2019-05-23 10:51:00,2.384,VUZI dzieler just keeps reposting the same assumption that the marginally redone identicle in form GG 2nd enterprise edition glass will eliminate the Vuzix M300 M300XL and the forthcoming M400 Absurd as his real mission here on this Vuzi Board DZ huge Kopn investor who has seen shareprice lose 300 over past year and who Shorted Vuzix at the wrong time to recoup losses kopn does supply Vuzix which leads to the only logical conclusion He is Short Vuzix Trying to get Vuzix shareholders to sell Vuzi and buy Kopn He has been at it for months but to no avail
M000,True,2019-05-23 10:48:00,2.371,VUZI Revenue growth continues 2 improve YOY 2019 expected to be by far best year yet with at least a 100 increase The space continues to expand and grow Every analyst sees Smart Glasses Ubiquitous in Enterprise space Do the math and s Millions of units to be sold Take a pick at a market share 5 10 20 30 any of those s means billions and they are at the front of the ecosystem list of providers so the higher end of those numbers are probably the most likely Their partners like AMZN ORCL HON are very busy to name a few
1st2Mkt,True,2019-05-23 10:43:00,2.4,VUZI I cant say it enough the mood around AR has shifted a lot in the last 6 8 months Bigger orders regardless of for whom will lead to more orders from everybody else and I like the product offerings V has put their features up against any other product being mass produced out there with bonus it is made in US People not already in the know are calling VZ and saying so whats up with the AR for enterprise thing can it really save us money And the indisputable answer is yes so why wouldnt it be adopted AR VZX 2019 The share price games are a bunch of 1st grade bullies taking advantage of little kids they will wet their pants when the 5th graders show up with serious cash
dzierler,,2019-05-23 10:41:00,2.371,KOPN is sole supplier to GOOG for all AR displays for Glass Enterprise Edition 2 This new device from GOOGL means VUZI may see trouble ahead seekingalphacomarticle42 Capital raise for Vuzix Terms wont be favourable now

growacet,,2019-05-23 10:33:00,2.364,VUZI pumpers go nuts when Vuzix gets a SA pump piece about a Mega Deal and ignore the lack of facts in favor of forward looking nonmaterial hype More facts in this piece though which means pumpers will say to ignore it because facts dont matter seekingalphacomarticle42
