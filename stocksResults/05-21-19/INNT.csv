mattfisher701,True,2019-05-21 09:57:00,1.401,INNT its hard to read these bio stocks that spike after lows they hit lows over and over and eventually spike and then it seems like the lows are the cause of the rally but in reality things like BPTH confirmed new lows multiple times before its final explosion Hopefully this is sooner rather than later
