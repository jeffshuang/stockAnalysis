GLordPhil,,2019-05-21 13:11:00,1.731,NEOS Im liking the back and forth battle today Solid trading to decide on this being the bottom level If the bears win Ill be looking for a strong rebound This is a good bottom for cash levelconcerns but I think this technology is undervalued and the value is much higher I bought a good bit yesterday 170 and had reinvested heavily at 180 did pull out completely at 195 to try to save a bit of capitol and preserve my valued position in this If it goes down Ill keep adding below 170 I want a position about 30 higher at this pricelevel
