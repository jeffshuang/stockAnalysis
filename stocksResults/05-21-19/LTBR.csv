ECerus,,2019-05-21 14:20:00,0.9694,LTBR Oh I was wrong about the algos Instead we have the BlueMoon Counterbalance occurring Similar to a friendly game of poker where everyone at the table AND EVERY DAMN TABLE IN THE CASINO happens to say simultaneously after checking their hand one more timeIm good and everyone stays pat AND ITS DRAWWelcome to the BlueMoon Counterbalance
Arpeggio,,2019-05-21 14:09:00,0.9659,LTBR nothing stopping EDF from picking up shares on the cheapjust like national Chinese dollars shorting it
tradeintherain,,2019-05-21 13:56:00,0.9611,LTBR Oops Thats a DAY 90 minutes of algo masterbation Epic
tradeintherain,,2019-05-21 13:45:00,0.9611,LTBR 90 minutes of algo masterbation Yawn
tradeintherain,,2019-05-21 13:44:00,0.9611,LTBR Who would risk jail torture and or slow painful death rehypothecating our shares to destroy us Someone with a state license to commit fraud Someone too big to fail Someone with billions of dollars to plug the hole on their balance sheet WE REPRESENT FREEDOM and everybody who loves power hates freedom for others
BusinessClass,,2019-05-21 13:43:00,0.9611,LTBR Its hard to tell how much Lightbridge is fronting aka window dressing with these recent announcements They need the price over 1 and Nuscale EDF are newsworthy but by now theyve realized the market wants proof revenue andor nondilutive funding from sources like the DOE It seems like the market is saying Is that all youve got Im always seeing other nuclear products be it fusion SMR or Triso getting hundreds of millions in funding But here we have LTBR pumping out shares at 50 cents Why didnt Framatome step in with a few million There was a time I thought Seth was concerned with retaining IP rights since Framatome would want something in return for their investment but I now think they nor any source of capital wants to commit any resource be it reactor access or money until and IF LTBR gets a DOE grant I somewhat wonder if even that is enough but I think it is Im sure LTBR could live on without the DOE but not as a public company and we will fund the loss
anonimbus,True,2019-05-21 12:24:00,0.9699,LTBR Enriched uraniummetallic fuel UrZr has been used in Soviet icebreaker reactors OK900 for years and years The fuelalloycladdingcoextrusion has already been proven to work and work very well The main innovation in LTBR fuel is the geometry and the main challenge is 1 manufacturing the complex geometry precisely and flawlessly and 2 testing the unique geometry for failure using conventional testing methods This is not as groundbreaking as Seth sometimes makes it out to be which is actually good for investors It is a lower risk undertaking than it appears The main time hurdles are regulatory in nature I believe the funding will be there for Enfission as every regulatory hurdle is crossed over time
ECerus,,2019-05-21 12:15:00,0.9699,LTBR Resistance at 97 I need to see the technical algo on this one Who comes up with this rhetorical How would that even be valued
Jester64,,2019-05-21 10:28:00,0.9568,LTBR Bought another 10k shs
MyBullRun,,2019-05-21 10:26:00,0.9568,LTBR So did Seth get his raise yesterday I didnt make it to the meeting
fred54,,2019-05-21 10:08:00,0.965,LTBR EDF and MOUs will be meaningless in the face of a DOE rejection Like it or not it comes down to this Why Because for the first time a group of independent experts will sit down and analyze the merits of LTBR fuel and its commercial viability Until further notice the market is treating Framatome as a supplier NOT a partner in it to get paid Siemens is so old and insipid it never counted for squat So this is it either they green light it or reject it and if the latter I dont care what Seth says or does its reverse split and basically over
Arpeggio,,2019-05-21 09:56:00,0.9699,LTBR EDF adds credibility to a company with very little and NO income Given the possibility of administrative change in two years its like adding T bills to your portfolio Brick by brick things are falling into place It sends a strong message to the DOE that the French want this technology to succeed
