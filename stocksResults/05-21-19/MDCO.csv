sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 14:35:00,33.986,MDCO I agree with that analyst from Roth I said earlier that I thought the stock should be trading at 3840 because of the dataand he basically said the clean 3 year data supports a move of 20 or more higher in this case which would take it to 3960 vs Fri closeshort mafia games continue yet NO analysts support the short position all are bullish and a few are wildly bullish
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 14:28:00,34.035,MDCO the Roth Capital analyst thinks the clean 3 year data should move the stock at least 20 highernote it is ONLY 3 since the close on Friday because of the short mafia holding it down Roth Cap Anlysts comments below Believes the clean safety for Inclisiran over three years across a large cohort of patients should put the bearish safety overhang of siRNA drugs to rest and thus move MDCO at least by 20
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 14:19:00,34.016,MDCO ORION3 shows sound 3year inclisiran safety At May 27 European Atherosclerosis Society Congress that could be the next catalyst as more data for Inclisiran will be availableAND the Inclisiran Ph3 pivotal trial data is expected in Q3
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 14:10:00,33.964,MDCO I sense the shorts are in denial and they are going to continue to manipulate this stockbut at some point they WILL get squeezed badly I also think a deal could happen at ANY POINT now Why once the Ph3 data is out and it gets approved the price tag will go up a lot If you are SNY PFE and want to save 23 Bil you should buyout MDCO today I continue to think there could be a bidding war after Ph3 approval which would just add to buyout costs This could be a highly sought after product early data supports this thesis IMO
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 14:02:00,33.975,MDCO Roth Capital analyst Yasmeen Rahimi Calls the data transparency in the NLA presentation a smart move and it validated the utility of MDCOs model in the real world in their view not only do they think it tempers the bears but believes it ultimately increases the MA price tagWith their belief that all investor eyes are on safety and with the read out in line with ORION1 thinks MDCOORION3 hit all the right keysBelieves the clean safety for Inclisiran over three years across a large cohort of patients should put the bearish safety overhang of siRNA drugs to rest and thus move MDCO at least by 20Price target is 75 based on a riskadjusted net present value rNPV analysis and estimates 70B peak sales for Inclisiran in the US and EU rating is Buy
sell1buy2,,2019-05-21 13:12:00,33.853,MDCO SVB Leerink LLC analyst Joseph P Schwartz Notes the ORION3 Readout Bolsters Confidence in MDCO hitting the 55 mark in Ph3 and highlights the results in the treatment regimen most similar to Ph3 where mean was 56Notes Inclisirans excellent safety and efficacy profile is superior to approved PCSK9 antibodies though the company did report one death attributed to ASCVD and one ALT elevation that was ascribed to medication for an unrelated condition that said their analysis of of ORION3 shows that ORION3 subjects experienced a much lower percentage of ALT elevationsdeaths whether related or unrelated to drug treatment compared to other PCSK9 inhibitorsThey rate MDCO Outperform with a price target of 61I do NOT think they are including potential acquisition in their target price and I believe there is a VERY HIGH probability it does get acquired

sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 10:07:00,33.795,MDCO numerous times over past few yrs there has been great news and yet the stock didnt get the response that I would have expectedwhy aggressive manipulation by the short mafia and getting the algos to follow what they are doing Saw the same thing last OctNov and shares are 80100 so be patient they are trying to get you to panic and sell your long so they can cover their short Given the weekend news it should be trading at 3840 right now IMO
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 09:51:00,34.222,MDCO is being manipulated by the short mafia again once again this is exactly what they do when they are WRONG We saw it in Oct Nov when the stock was 80100 lower and seeing it again after extremely good news 13 analysts publish research on MSCO all 13 have a BUY or Outperform avg px tgt is 5775 I reiterate that some of these target prices are too low and need to come up 3 analysts have Buy ratings and target price btwn 3639 those target prices are WAY TOO LOW given the huge potential for drug Inclisiran Note one analyst has a target price of 90 and one has a target px of 110
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 09:35:00,34.653,MDCO 110 price target at Baird should tell you something about the upside potentialshorts are WRONG long investors should be patient and ignore the HFT and shorts IMO
sell1buy2,True,2019-05-21 09:32:00,34.771,MDCO Baird analyst Madhu Kumar raises target While they believe bears will cling to the single liver enzyme elevation event observed in ORION3 thinks several considerations make that untenable and the results have increased their conviction in inclisiran ascending the iron throne of PCSK9 drugs in ORION91011Reiterates their Outperform rating and raises target to 110 from 80
