LionsFan,,2019-05-21 15:18:00,1.069,PULM Buyout watch Day 5 Stock trading horizontally again for the fifth straight session The mood on ST is antsy Posters still touting their ridiculous 220 buyouts while others have their more reasonably placed 5 10 buyouts in mind Ever since RC left the company theres been a sense of new found optimism spread through the investment community Time will tell whether PULM will break the wheel and lead us to the promised land or end up like a WebVan vehicle at a used car parking lot

Haimalon,,2019-05-21 13:44:00,1.07,PULM i just see the warrants the just spread I wonder for what in the last two years they burned 40 m and didnt have nothing real instead of having warrants they need to buy real stock and show some confidence in the company they managing Raaad your start is not good hope you will bring some value here

je0922,,2019-05-21 12:29:00,1.079,PULM Interesting to note that on 6617 with numbers similar to what they are now the SP was at 2700 I would suggest that Pulmatrix is much stronger now due to recent events The 2200 target seems conservative
