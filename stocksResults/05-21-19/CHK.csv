LuvMyBonds,,2019-05-21 10:56:00,2.335,CHK My opinion FWIW I am watching CHK and watching CL CHK We are starting to bottom but we cant establish that the bottom is in place yet It looks like we will bottom between 232 and 214When I look at CL it looks like it is forming an interim top Yesterday I published a causal model of CHK vs Oil One of my observations was that CHK tends to lead CL Assuming that CHK is leading CL the model predicts a decline in oil from the current level of about 62bbl to 4850bbl based on the current price of CHK and the likelihood that THE bottom of this move on wave 2 will be between 232 and 214The good news is that my model is predicting that we are closer to the end of the decline than the beginning If oil continues to correct from the 6660bbl high and completes its correction around 4850bbl as predicted by this decline in CHK then both oil and CHK should begin an aggressive move higher A related instrument XLE has established at least an interim bottom
