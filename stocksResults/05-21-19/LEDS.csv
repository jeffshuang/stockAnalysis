WizardTrader,True,2019-05-21 10:02:00,2.842,LEDS good swing in my opinion The pattern suggests an uptrend although it might take a few weeks to kick in IMO I thought anywhere from 260280 is a good entry point for a swing trade However this might be a long hold I expect this to peak within 6 weeks PT 550
