Jvardaro15,True,2019-05-21 15:26:00,20.258,EXEL Jesus why is this going cray today
s0r0s,True,2019-05-21 14:11:00,20.42,EXEL Never stop never stopping
Max_Gain,,2019-05-21 14:05:00,20.332,EXEL Today low on volume
simbha,,2019-05-21 13:58:00,20.312,EXEL Another 50 cents upside for this week
s0r0s,True,2019-05-21 12:31:00,20.32,EXEL bullish SAR crossover today
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 12:02:00,20.262,EXEL People have been asking me about BO Px Dont want to opine there however since ARRY is often brought up on this board as a comparator consider this ARRYs PriceSales is 194x vs EXELs 692x By that metric alone EXEL Px right now without BO should be around 54shr Industry PS is 7134x Cant do PE because ARRY doesnt have earnings yet
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 11:43:00,20.264,EXEL Nevertheless looks like Merck and EXEL have another trial together now
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 11:38:00,20.248,EXEL I wonder if EXEL got beat out of buying Peloton by Merck When asked about BO and HIF1a combo with CABO Morrissey brushed the question aside and wished them well Morrisey has been wanting to revisit mCRPC since his big fail it is his white whale From another source HIF1alpha has emerged as an important transcription factor in breast cancer and prostate cancer biology and is expressed in the early stages of mammary and prostate carcinogenesis Its expression is correlated with diagnostic and prognostic indicators for early relapse and metastatic disease thus making HIF1alpha a potential prognostic biomarker in proteomic assessments of breast and prostate cancers

jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 11:07:00,20.24,EXEL Looks like Mercks Keytruda failed its Ph3 KEYNOTE119 trial in the 2L 3L setting in triple neg breast cancer Maybe why the Peloton buyout HIF1alpha presence about 50 of the time in BC is indicative of a poor outcome Inhibit it along with a VEGF MET inhibitor Rx like CABO may allow a PD1 ICI IO to be more efficacious
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 10:39:00,20.153,EXEL This is the Peloton sponsored Ph2 trail of its HIFalpha with CABO clinicaltrialsgovct2show
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 10:34:00,20.148,EXEL The present study has demonstrated that 2methoxyestradiol 2ME2 an inhibitor of hypoxiainducible factors HIFs and a promising anticancer agent under investigation in clinical trials strengthens anticancer activities of cabozantinib against MTC cells in vitro and in vivo The activated hypoxiainducible pathways which are mainly regulated by HIF1 contribute to the resistance of hypoxic MTC cells to cabozantinib ncbinlmnihgovpubmed262
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 10:33:00,20.135,EXEL Todays Merck BO of Peloton news is great for EXEL too Somewhat validates earlier studies demonstrating inhibitors of hypoxiainducible factors HIF strengthens anticancer activities of Cabo Cabo upregulated HIF1alpha expression at translational levels increased expression of downstream factors VEGF HGF and MET
jedi_delta,,2019-05-21 10:28:00,20.105,EXEL They are looking to get latestage assets per Morrissey on todays call
Hatman,True,2019-05-21 10:16:00,20.118,EXEL Coming off the ball hard today Lets go
simbha,,2019-05-21 10:11:00,20.034,EXEL ARRY jumped 15 That is the runner Wow Market bets on ARRY more as a BO target EXEL is not in the BO list
simbha,,2019-05-21 10:09:00,20.079,EXEL Merck to buy cancer drug developer Peloton for 105 billion in cash
s0r0s,,2019-05-21 09:54:00,19.93,EXEL Weve got a runner
