Novo1,True,2019-05-21 10:06:00,17.19,AMRN If you still dont look at volume as the key to share price you shouldnt be in this stock The volume is indicative of interest low volume usually results in lower share prices since theyre fewer interested buyers One in a while the trend reverses and a low volume day results in a minimal increase in valuation Usually the reverse is the case Still comes down to whether news will increase volume which will result in increase share price valuation In my humble long term bag holding opinion
