tiwttwit,,2019-05-21 14:52:00,0.9756,BPMX Each day a new stock price low is reached Did this company even become compliant yet I am thinking it did not and with it now below 100 I can not see it happening They will have to do another RS split to try to keep compliant The company can not hold itself up even for 30 days Makes me wonder what plan they gave to NYSE to make then accept to try

rc168,,2019-05-21 14:23:00,0.9652,BPMX theres a 6 month or so time period of unaccountability between the time T was hired and the start of the rosacea study this past March Maybe in January or so T mentioned there would be no news until June but it sounds to me like a lot of pissed away time without any sense of urgency to change it

Steeldriver11,,2019-05-21 13:40:00,0.9526,BPMX yeah the current value would be 38 cents before the split All time low Very disappointed in them right now Launch a marketable product or get more patents 23 pending seriously 9 years of research is very disappointing If you email them they wont even get back to their investors Every decision is plagued by another bad one New Management has led 2 super low balled public offerings and a horrible split each appearing to have failed more than the next
