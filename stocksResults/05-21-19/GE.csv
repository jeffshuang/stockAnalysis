AskLou,,2019-05-21 15:50:00,9.915,GE I like to check the numbers after each quarterly report to see if Im missing anything So far no Im not Tangible net assets are a negative 35 Billion Operating Cash flow less capital expenditures over the prior 4 quarters is a negative 45 Billion So what does Mr Market say this business is worth 86 Billion Great thing about Mr Market is he can offer you a stock to invest in but you are under no obligation to buy Another iconic US industrial company has generated 747 Billion in free cash flow over the trailing 4 quarters has tangible net assets of 36 Billion and Mr Market says you can buy it for less than 41 Billion today I will buy the latter
