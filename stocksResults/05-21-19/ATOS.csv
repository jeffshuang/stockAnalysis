Susu_Rafraf,,2019-05-21 11:47:00,2.735,ATOS and AKTX have been very correlated They had their original big pops on the week of 3112019 and they both reverted back to trend lines for large bounces specifically off of then 50emasma lines again on the same week week of 42219 only separated by 1 Day on both pops Now ATOS has bounced off its 200ema line from 230 and it went to 283 AKTX has just touches it 200ema line today at 250 and if it follows the same correlated movements it would go back to 325 range This would be a good move for someone who wanted in but wasnt sure where to buy No guarantee it will go there and the low volume for AKTX is something I dont like Ill post ATOS chart here and in comment AKTX Take a look and see what you think Youll notice they are very correlated
