UndervaluedGems,,2019-05-21 13:39:00,1.123,NDRA Of course Im sure shorts already know Michael Thornton Chief Technology Officer who added shares yesterday was a founder and president of Enhanced Vision Systems Corp or EVS which was acquired by General Electric Company Doubt hed be adding if they needed to raise cash right now Nice resume and history with GE
TraderDansGame,True,2019-05-21 12:34:00,1.13,NDRA cheapies here filling all I can these levels
UndervaluedGems,,2019-05-21 12:27:00,1.13,NDRA Took a position Insider just added Dont see cash raise before data considering it should be available before Q3 And even if there is so what If you look at past raises there has been small pullbacks followed by considerable upsides prior to the recent fallout Also could do financing without dilution Theyre almost at the finish line after all these years and shorts or nervous longs have convinced many to dump their shares at 52 week lows Ive placed my bet Downside 1 Upside unlimited

Nomisma,,2019-05-21 10:59:00,1.16,NDRA Its also possible considering the fact that the previous dump did not carry it all the way to the bottom that the red line here is the new lower baseline
Bread_collector,,2019-05-21 10:53:00,1.162,NDRA well that didnt work lol what else they got up their sleeve to dilute
Nomisma,,2019-05-21 10:34:00,1.16,NDRA Francios loves a couple head fake spikes on the way down to his favorite baseline
