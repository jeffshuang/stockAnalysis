stvcone,True,2019-05-21 14:53:00,4.982,CVM I went to the shareholders meeting yesterday All very positive Here is my take1 IDMC saying to continue the trial to completion They rarely if ever end a trial early If we are already reached the proposed 10 improvement the trial the clinicians still need to know what the final number is2 They have enough cash on hand to continue for another year3 The longer the trial goes the better the outcome I may be oversimplifying but we would have reached 440 events deaths if they were all in the SOC arm of the trial 55 survival at 3 years via SOC times the 800 patients enrolled in the SOC and Multikine MK only arms of the study 128 patients are receiving MK plus low level chemo The first patient was enrolled in 2011 but the trial was fully enrolled as of 916 We arent in September yet but there were a large number of patients treated well before 92016 so I think we can easily use the 440 number How are we not at 298 events yet
