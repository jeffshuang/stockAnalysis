RealETA,True,2019-05-21 13:13:00,54.33,ARNA Etrasimod and its Ph3 Trials design have made this a ridiculously lowrisk buyout target for the big boy Pharmas The further along we go the higher the potential BO price With Arena babysittingoverseeing trial sites expediting enrollment as much as 2x faster than a normal Ph3 trial and the ridiculously good data from Ph12 Im expecting a BO offer as soon as the ELEVATE trial doses its first patient With a decent offer big pharma can get Etrasimod for lower than FMV by buying early in Ph3 and theyll get olorinab thrown in for free basically which is nothing but upside for them if it turns out to be half as good as people think I think we see a 8B offer upon ELEVATEs 1st dosing and then a bidding war with 1 or 2 other Pharmas Winning bid will be 95B and 180200share by January
