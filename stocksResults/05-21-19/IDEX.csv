MonkTrader,False,2019-05-21 14:59:00,1.59,IDEX its funny how bulls are all about GTB now and forget about all the other deals but they forget that GTB is just a token with unlimited supply and the market cap on it means shit to the crypto community nor GTB in general Ask any influencer if they ever heard of GTB and they will tell you what GTB The bag holders here will pump GTB until Q2 and unless the company has converted to USD the bag holders will continue to praise this meaningless token with no real utility but to rewards users of their dumb mobile app thats only used in parts of Asia Us users dont even use GTDollar
