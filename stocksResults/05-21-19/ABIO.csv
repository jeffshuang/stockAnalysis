WarmingTrend,,2019-05-21 15:21:00,7.935,ADVM This is virtually identical to what PHAS did on Ph 1 news Took about 2 weeks to go from 350 to 1650 Before that ABIO and AMRN come to mind

TitoMojito,False,2019-05-21 13:06:00,7.978,ABIO finally closed my short position at an average of 797 Made a gross profit of 39600 but ended up paying 12285 in interest and fees for hardtoborrow shares Still a net profit of 27315 over 3 weeksThat being said at one point I was down almost 200000 and had to leverage additional capital This was a rough one to hold and Im disappointed management didnt drop an offering Biotechs are almost always overvalued when news drops Even if it takes a while 90 of the time they come back to more realistic valuations
TrayDURRRR,False,2019-05-21 12:52:00,7.975,ABIO LOL This is what you get for pumping lies

TheRealGil,,2019-05-21 10:28:00,7.753,ABIO 50 average the only time when having big bags is nothing to brag about 0
Justified,True,2019-05-21 10:19:00,7.894,ABIO Im holding my bags for a bit longer and still have a price target of around 13 Although there will be lots of other bag holders who will be looking to get out anywhere near their entry point so the ride up may be choppyHopefully well get some news which could send it parabolic with the low float and high short interest Otherwise Ill cut my losses and move on
MediumSkillLevel,,2019-05-21 10:12:00,7.948,ABIO That was nice while it lasted
TitoMojito,False,2019-05-21 09:58:00,8.282,ABIO trying to cover a 20k short with no volume is frustrating Hoping to get out sub850 but still need to pick up another 17k shares
Justified,True,2019-05-21 09:45:00,8.336,ABIO Im liking the price action even after the amended offering A good sign for bulls It should be time for shorts to cover and start pushing this back upIt could start climbing fast once it gets started Lots of shorts still involved Well see
