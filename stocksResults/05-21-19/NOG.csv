chrome1254,True,2019-05-21 14:40:00,2.24,NOG Before the year is out the share price for NOG will exceed 5 bucks No doubts in my mind so what does anything matter right now except to buy every share you can Folks honestly thats 270 almost 3 dollars more per share Thats a double and then some in less than 6 months Even being conservative we will reach 4 and thats nearly 2 bucks Just get all the shares you can and make your own destiny Thats a lot of FU cash

JRMF,,2019-05-21 11:25:00,2.235,NOG DNR Also looking for thoughts on APIEIA reports in general Since OPEC is talking keeping cuts in place does the gov start saying we are having draws now for the next couple weeks before the OPEC meeting to convince them we need more production then BAM back to huge builds in late June again Short term pain long term gain to them by letting oil rise for a couple weeks to get OPEC to stop cuts for the rest of the year Does that sound like something they would do
