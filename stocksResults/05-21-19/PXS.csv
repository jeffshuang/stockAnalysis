sgrosse1,True,2019-05-21 10:30:00,1.137,PXS imagine we actually get a good ER Hahaa this thing wouldnt know what to do with itself But even if we get a horrible one it really is irrelevant shareholders here have smartened up and know the value of what they hold in any case anything sub 150 is an absolute bargain and you will be handsomely rewarded come OctNov
MoneyLord,,2019-05-21 10:27:00,1.137,PXS probably not the best idea to buy before the ER but I picked up shares again at 113 this morning will step out today if It reaches 118 or just hold through the ER Good luck to all
