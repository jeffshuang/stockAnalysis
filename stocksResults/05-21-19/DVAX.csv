ascintor,True,2019-05-21 11:47:00,6.37,DVAX immunooncologynewscom201 You can bet MRK is at least considering some collaborative investment here in view of their most recent news on Keytrudas lagging efficacy alone

poorguy,True,2019-05-21 10:32:00,6.21,DVAX I lost lots of money by long term investment in this company because of trusting this CEO but he is a big liar who doesnt have a plan in advance and lack of managementdont loose your money

poorguy,True,2019-05-21 10:12:00,6.21,DVAX I am wondering why management including F CEO didnt make a plan to issue 1020 M shares once Hep B Vaccine has been approved to make the company financially secure It brings 200400M and of course has a dilution effect on stock but much better than we are now
