Quagglerock,,2019-05-21 11:06:00,5.41,ADMS I cannot believe that theyve let it stay this low for so long I cant imagine there has been no interest by other companies to scoop this up for cheap Its 500600m market cap without the MS indication Youd think someone would have the urgency to get it before the price jumps For many companies the big boys would wait until cash or debt became an issue They know that isnt going to happen here
