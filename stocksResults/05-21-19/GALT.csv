btdiver,True,2019-05-21 14:26:00,4.485,GALT Ive done my best to point the corporate actions department in the direction of the prospectus and its language and Im confident that they will come to realize their errorThat said this is with a major national brokerage and im surprised with their confusion I highly encourage everyone who has an interest in the rights offering to confirm with their broker the details of their subscription and over subscription It would be a disaster to have brokerages around the country failing to participate in the offering on their clients instructions because they incorrectly perceived there was Insufficient cash in their clients accounts
btdiver,True,2019-05-21 14:25:00,4.485,GALT WARNINGI have just spoken with the corporate actions department of my broker dealer and Ive come to find that they are confused about the offering They are suggesting that the price is 550 per unit not share This is absurd as it would imply that that anyone would be willing to pay 550 for less than a third of a share plus a warrantWould be the worst offering in the history of the market Would mean that someone who wished to fully participate with 5000 shares would have to send in 27500 more than the value of their entire GALT position with hopes of receiving 1500 shares and 375 warrants Ouch Pretty pricey
Kilarck,True,2019-05-21 14:24:00,4.485,GALT This might be what potential partners or acquirers were waiting on This should technically invalidate the exclusivity BMY and MRK currently have on PD1PDL1 pathway because two of the original inventors were not included in those agreements Big pharma will be scrambling to secure licensing with this new group More competition will mean more aggressive development of PD1PDL1 inhibitor combos biospacecomarticledanaf
