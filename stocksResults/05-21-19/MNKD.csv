jublin1,,2019-05-21 14:38:00,1.298,MNKD I am feeling the MMs are trying to get people to buy before the dilution comes so it is higher for the cash to keep the company afloat for another few months
Dictatorsaurus,,2019-05-21 14:32:00,1.3,MNKD Someone please ask Nate if we are still a strong buy at 30 and a buy at 45 These were his exact words
Dictatorsaurus,,2019-05-21 14:16:00,1.287,MNKD Why does Nate refuse to answer simple questions and always revert back to his newsletter That blog isnt worth wiping your butt with

g_2,,2019-05-21 13:40:00,1.285,MNKDnatesnotes Hey Nate Im disappointed in your response to multiple users having been a long time subscriber its something I would not expect On at least 4 occasions users have asked what your thoughts were on MNKD after earnings In each case you point people to your comments prior to earnings then tell them to read slowly or they didnt read answer is there If you dont want to share your thoughts since the earnings just say so Ive done very well on your stocks over the years with MNKD being the big exception down 96 on what I still hold

greekmafioso,True,2019-05-21 12:55:00,1.275,MNKD speaking of revenue generation at some point the quarter over quarter doubledigit rev growth will capture the attention of nondilutive debt financing to further fund the growth of Afrezza That day is coming longs dont lose site of that And sooner than you think Imo
SuiGeneris,,2019-05-21 12:53:00,1.275,MNKD I believe more longs are being squeezed out of their position than shorts Patience has its limit

SuiGeneris,,2019-05-21 12:19:00,1.281,MNKD In retrospect the consistent high short selling interest for this ticker clearly indicates how poorly run MNKD is how Wall Street perceives management as irresponsible incompetent and unable to generate revenues while giving themselves undeserved compensation Overhead way too high for a single product company

kevinmik,,2019-05-21 11:18:00,1.29,MNKD stock price aint going nowhere not until Mannkind gets the balls to move forward with a major restructuring of the company It can either be a major partnership preferably with the partner taking an equity stake in Mannkind sell Afrezza asset to another company or split Mannkind into 2 separate companies Current structure is woefully inadequate too small to maximize the huge value created by Al Manns Inhaled Drug Delivery System for multiple drugs and diseases Afrezza for diabetes both that now enjoy FDA Approval
