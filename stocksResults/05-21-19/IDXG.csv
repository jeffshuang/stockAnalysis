macHeez,,2019-05-21 11:41:00,0.6901,IDXG My beef with Stover 1 On 10102018 he released a statement saying the recently filed S3 was a routine corporate activity and that they expect to do it again in 3 years when it expires This was to clarify any potential confusion in the marketplace that has transpired since we filed a Form S3 shelf registration statement What potential confusion might that be Many of us thought this was to assure us that there was no near term need for dilution On 1242019 Stover announces a 7M public offering leaving many of us feeling manipulated 2 On 1232019 the day before the offering announcement the stock opens at 107 and closes at 089 indicating some illegal insider trading No action is ever taken 3 In 2017 the company had 159M in revenue and Stover took home 21M in total compensation CEOs at bigger companies make much less than this 4 At the last offering Stover was awarded 87k shares while shareholders loss a tremendous amount of equity
