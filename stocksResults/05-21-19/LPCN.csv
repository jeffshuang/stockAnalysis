Limited_Edition,True,2019-05-21 10:49:00,1.66,LPCN not cleanest of charts but Im playing this strictly off of support with a stop loss of 151 Target 1 is to break 190 then over 2 If we can get over 2 then I think it has potential to test 24 Looking to see if it will reclaim the 200EMA in a day or two if its going my way
