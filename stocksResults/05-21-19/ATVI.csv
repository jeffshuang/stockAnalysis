freddyfish05,False,2019-05-21 13:35:00,43.701,ATVI Naturally this stock is due for some type of price breakdown small or big The stock has been in a buying cycle for 18 weeks and price was barely able to break out of the 278 4729 extension level Now the stock has finally broken down through the 300 extension 4442 Could very well travel to the next Fibonacci level of 4119 before stopping and reversing

BlizzardRob,True,2019-05-21 09:44:00,43.915,ATVI I may have massively underestimated the potential of WoW Classic Literally dozens of people who I played with over the years and have since quit the game are making plans to come back Small sample size and selfconfirmation bias aside it surprised me as these individuals all swore theyd never play WoW again never subscribe again never be interested again The nostalgia factor is actually insane WoW Classic in August MW4 release in OctNov and Diablo 4 reveal in November rumored would be a nice jolt to the heart for ATVI And lets be realistic this is NOT going up without news or proof that theyre actually serious about energizing their boring lineup as it stands
