BioMD12,True,2019-05-21 11:28:00,0.715,DRRX sitting in limbo but not for long A lot of institutional investors wont touch with a delisting notice outstanding Under 1 and 250MM market cap doesnt help either as most shops have tight guidelines on micros
Jsmithxc11,,2019-05-21 11:27:00,0.715,PIR put on my watchlist when it jumped near 1 glad I didnt add but looking for entry Might want to look into FBIO or DRRX Do your own DD but imo good buys
ld4,,2019-05-21 10:22:00,0.73,DRRX From 928 AH trial Drs Every patient weve put in my group had a response to the treatment And the main response we see bilirubin improving Once bilirubin improving everything starts to change The MELD score changes The MELD rate changes Whatever scoring system you use bilirubin is a key element in this disease and we have been seeing improvement in the bilirubin within the first few days Im very enthusiastic and I think the FDA will be very very excited to have a product in this field thats presented to them and shows efficacy in this underserved patient population I would be shocked if they didnt fasttrack it because there are no other therapies and the outcomes are so terrible So I think the path to get this product approved if this product is tolerable and efficacious as it looks like early on the track in my mind would be relatively quick The stock is wildly undervalued buying with confidence Life saving drug life changing riches
Jsmithxc11,True,2019-05-21 10:09:00,0.73,DRRX excited for when this is steady over 1
