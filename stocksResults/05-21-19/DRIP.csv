UniquelyJames,,2019-05-21 10:30:00,10.006,starting a small position here on DRIP I have 11 shares at a 1008 average I feel like this is going to do some more dropping today so I will pick up more shares along the way Just making sure to manage my risk here instead of diving in 500 shares all at once
