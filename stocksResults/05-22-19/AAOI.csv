Dustoff82,,2019-05-22 14:31:00,9.2,AAOI The SP collapse was not caused by Trump or the trade war or China The salient issue is poor leadership mixed into a perfect storm of product quality issues cyclicality in data center demand short attacks and legal attacks In response the company has been more opaque than ever and has not publicly defended itself in any way The outcome is highly predictable One thing and one thing only will save AAOI improved performance And its very likely we wont know anything about that until the next ER So we wait
