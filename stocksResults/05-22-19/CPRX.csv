prodofchem,,2019-05-22 15:38:00,3.534,CPRX Im long on this stock and Im not budging Hard to tell how much of this pull is preholiday offloading related but we all know the fundamentals I am tempted to sell just so I can increase my share count over the several few days but I suspect this will rebound in the next week or two either way Could be quick could be a walk back up but we know where this is headed
TesttheWaters,,2019-05-22 15:37:00,3.535,CPRX Bought Vericel ASTM at the time when it was 250 and then it popped to 6 on FDA approval of MACI They did what I considered a great offering the next day and the shorts and MMs used it to drive it back to the 2s They screwed with it and accumulated shares so did I for a YEAR Then it popped to 9 12 17 and peaked at 20 Sitting at around 1516 now with plenty of future upside Patience and confidence in what you own can be life changing

swoods,,2019-05-22 14:08:00,3.63,CPRX FTW u are still holding into that 300000 number U will be grossly disappointed when that number is well below yours Come on now get realistic and consider how many patients will be granted grossly reduced bills because they will not have insurance Even management has indicated that per their conference call And u are not taking into account the forced price reduction do to competition and govt pressure

TesttheWaters,,2019-05-22 12:45:00,3.745,CPRX Up from 223 to 384 in 10 trading days and yall are concerned over a 10 cent pullback Seriously
Investbythenumbers,True,2019-05-22 12:38:00,3.759,CPRX My guess is that they reached out to the fda and probably will have a meeting If in the meeting the fda does not agree that Jacobus will NOT be allowed to sell to the adult market without further trials then I believe the company will take legal action to prevent Jacobus from selling their drug off label Furthermore I believe the fda will want to avoid legal action since their decision to approve Jacobuss product was politically motivated and they did not follow protocol for approving the drug
tharpoon,,2019-05-22 12:36:00,3.749,CPRX slowly bleeding out to 350 this week YN

swoods,,2019-05-22 11:54:00,3.69,CPRX my take is that management is looking for language to soften the blow of competition and price reductions Big investors wont like that and most will wait until next year to see if new drugs are alproved
arang,False,2019-05-22 11:50:00,3.693,CPRX might just sell my 20k shares as well Their bs Will update in few days nevah update

arang,,2019-05-22 11:39:00,3.673,CPRX This dumb management think they have luxury of time to delay the update hoho
tharpoon,,2019-05-22 10:54:00,3.741,CPRX Reminder its common for many stocks to sell off several days leading up to a long holiday weekend because traders dont want to carry risk even if fundamentals are strong Its also common for those stocks to rally again the next trading day This can present excellent profit opportunities So dont get too stressed over this shortterm selloff Hope you find this helpful
