0ldg0vman,,2019-05-22 11:38:00,1.53,SNES My PMP indicates that FASTRAC AllWeatherBlox is four times as expensive as the older 1st generation anticoagulants Of course the chemical product cost appears to be about 17 of the total cost including labor trucks and fuel profit etc of a treatment I have asked my PMP to quote me on ContraPest to get some idea of how much more it might cost to be used in my monthly treatment

0ldg0vman,,2019-05-22 11:29:00,1.53,SNES Since SGARs have been banned for consumer sales and use in California since 2014 that would seem to leave first generation anticoagulants whose lack of effectiveness led to the use of SGARs in the first place Bromethalin a neurotoxin made by Bell Labs and marketed as FASTRAC AllWeather Blox and Contrapest as the remaining chemical tools for PMPs I would be interested in any comments by members of this board about Bromethalin It appears that it has a half life of six days in rodents and 178 days in the soil and that there is no antidote for poisoning from Bromethalin There appears to be some possibility of contamination of streams and lakes with this product and there can be some possibility of pass through poisoning as well In reading the EPA label for this product it appears that it can be placed within 100 feet of structures whereas ContraPest is limited by its label to 1 foot
