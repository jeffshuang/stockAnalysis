MR_R0B0T,True,2019-05-22 15:33:00,3.165,TXMD stop bitching cause you sold your position Common sense stocks obviously not going to breakout until there are solid earning which is at least 3 quarters away at the minimum If you cant take the pressure stop buying stocks If I sold every time a stock took a Id be broke I will only sell if the company has bad news and in this case there is none just a bunch of desperate shorts trying to clear and exit There time is coming to an end maybe not this year but certainly next year after q4 is announced especially if we hit the 25 million imvexxy consensus sales target
h8ster,,2019-05-22 15:31:00,3.166,TXMD FYI for every penny this drops the CEOs shares of txmd falls 206665K
Maddog64,True,2019-05-22 15:19:00,3.155,TXMD hard to compare an early stage pharmaceutical company to the IBB especially when they have no track record for products they just started selling and or products approved but have not launched yet
00retPA,False,2019-05-22 15:15:00,3.151,TXMD shorts arent the reason Txmd has crashed yet again for the 6th straight yr they are capitalizing on a scumbag management with a weak one plan that has failed time and time again see loan slide and dilution history

00retPA,False,2019-05-22 14:57:00,3.17,TXMD Wow I bring up some good points about loan insider selling and dilution timing the fact that of course Rob might buy a few shares after making 5M off of us and that timing and number of bear catalysts from CEO just isnt quite right and the jerks call me prepackaged and a troll but they have ZERO COUNTER ARGUMENTS EXCEPT 3 APPROVED DRUGS AND SHORTS SUCK
Maddog64,True,2019-05-22 14:46:00,3.16,TXMD Peepac is a troll or just really weird and way too much time on his hands
Maddog64,,2019-05-22 14:28:00,3.148,TXMD holding until all 3 products that were approved by the FDA last year have all been selling for a six month minimum and or until they get bought out by another company for a much higher price than where it is selling today You sell here you lose out Peepac has been on this board for years slaming the company daily I dont trust someone with that much time on their hands to only post negatived daily on TXMD for years must be getting paid They just started selling Bijuva that has a 5 Billion market opportunity and they have not yet sold Annovera another 5 Billion market opportunity

StankyPigano,,2019-05-22 13:44:00,3.137,ADMP NYMX TXMD For LT investors who like to buy dips these stocks have provided a virtual wonderland of opportunity past few months I remain convinced all will be multibaggers next few years Im mystified by TXMD actionproducts and launch strategies are great and execution has been flawless Low risk 5bagger next few years imho NYMX is still risky but BPH drug should be a blockbuster when approved And ADMP probably turns the corner when partner Sandoz launches Symjepi to compete with EpiPen next few weeks Glta longs

00retPA,False,2019-05-22 12:51:00,3.145,TXMD BO hmmmm See SGYP their CEO went as far as to say he was looking for a buyer while dumping 100 of his shares comeon now no conspiracy theories really I think it was loan tranche failure and loan terms plus delay of 001 launch which increases adjudication time and the serious delay in 004 adjudication plus the very real risk of dilution
Sparky_R,,2019-05-22 12:49:00,3.147,TXMD Money pit Never ever again Change the ticker to TURD
suburban90210,,2019-05-22 12:40:00,3.14,TXMD my theory is that this is a private equity play to short sp and then come in with 35x sp for buyout

00retPA,False,2019-05-22 12:22:00,3.138,TXMD Yea this isnt shorts this is institutional selling to reduce risk in their portfolios and maybe some shorts plus there are strict guidelines for fund managers that force them to sell under 543 etc perfect storm that Scumbag CEO has not prepared a defense
StocksRup,True,2019-05-22 12:16:00,3.137,TXMD The shorts are taking all the longs out I get it after years of poor SP performance unless you sell the spikes and trade it like I do its a nightmare to watchhold Im in the hole on my latest swing with an avg around 350 But I wont be selling into this oversold BS do your own DD dont listen to the false info posted all over this board Not surprised to see longs throw in the towel but think about it if you bought yearsmonths ago why the hell would you sell now Both products are finally launched and now you sell On top of that their launch strategy is working and will continue to grow with great refill numbers Anyways thats my 2 cents for today Holding
00retPA,,2019-05-22 12:14:00,3.135,TXMD Where is Dimbleweef he promised me this was a new company after 004 approval and they wouldnt be screwing is anymore That shorts were going to cover and SP would stop 6yr bear trend NutmegEuro

StocksRup,True,2019-05-22 11:55:00,3.163,TXMD All noise The new loan agreement is much better then previois and cash is not a problem If you know how to read even at a 5th grade level you will see thats not the reason for the drop Its slow ajudication which is temporary People expect huge revenue right away and use it for short power Not worth watching day to day unless you wanna go crazy

00retPA,False,2019-05-22 09:37:00,3.273,TXMD Looks like that micro buy by TT has fallen on deaf ears Nice try scumbag if you want to dilute to insure the 60M on hand for tranche you will have to do it under 24
00retPA,False,2019-05-22 09:35:00,3.283,TXMD June 8th will be one full yr of TXMD crash that started with at the time an unneeded dilution at 510 and insider selling both perfectly timed to give their short interests a good yr to pay off all while getting 2030M richer in personal wealth for the board
