RealStratBecker,,2019-05-22 14:57:00,0.213,HK Not easy to track movement on such an unpredictable ticker with volume this low Now that volume is closer to normalaverage were seeing runups into closes with volume pushing past ask walls Very keen to keep an eye on this considering the over 4 million bids last night and a 16 million buy at the close level during afterhours Keep an eye on this

Ghostbuster,False,2019-05-22 12:10:00,0.2215,WLL CHK HK wish I never invested in oil a few years ago EVERY SINGLE ONE that I picked is down significantly and some even out
FPVhead,True,2019-05-22 10:34:00,0.2155,HK looks like a bottom structure is forming in log
FPVhead,,2019-05-22 10:01:00,0.2101,HK unfortunately the only way to stop this behavior is to own the shares and trust in each other by valuing the shares as they should be rather than as they engineered it to be by the CEOplatforms like Stocktwits should help with this stuff in the future
Rainsjd,,2019-05-22 09:55:00,0.2092,HK A nice analysis thank you its beyond frustrating that we have no insight into what the Floydless management team and the board have in mind If they execute on a plan that you have described Id think their actions would fall into the category of conspiracy to defraud investors Ultimately they have a legallybinding fiduciary commitment to their shareholders
FPVhead,,2019-05-22 09:47:00,0.2177,HK no more h2s problems and new wells all coming online at the same time after the biggest cost is through and laid off on shareholders the drillingIf you look youll see most of these companies drilled first and are trying to go bankruptThey will then frac and whatnot after the drilling costs have been dissolved to shareholders through restructure At his point the operating margin is through the roof No drilling costs and land is paid forThis is criminal behavior and the SEC should not allow for such a loss to common shareholders when it is built on their backs
FPVhead,True,2019-05-22 09:39:00,0.227,HK Ceiling impairment is such a shadey number to skew loss to common shareholders due to the price of oil having that massive V bottom that put the average price of that quarter to value the reserves Thats clearly not true as it will be worth much more by the time its taken out of the ground or the land is soldthis was an attempt at a massive push into BK but Im not sure they pulled it off
