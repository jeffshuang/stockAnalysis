TAFA,,2019-05-22 11:03:00,6.022,VHC cafc already validated virnetxs patents and are on record calling ptab rulings against virnetx incoherent
IPcurious,,2019-05-22 10:26:00,6.15,VHC honestly at this point V should go public and start contacting the New York Times Washington post etc to start laying the foundation for what is happening before their eyes and thats corruption at its finest Let the cafc know all eyes are on them and they cant brush this under the rug for their friend Apple CCC should begin the media campaign immediately
IPcurious,,2019-05-22 10:24:00,6.16,VHC looks like I may be right the cafc could be waiting for the PTAB appeal to hit their desk on June 4th If they manage somehow to agree with PTAB invalidations and toss out Vs entire case I will be shocked but not surprised This entire appeal has been fishy and the cafc is going to find any way to help apple My stop loss was triggered at 615 and Im currently on the sidelines I can see this going to 5 in the coming days as people start to see the writing on the wall Be careful everyone
WitchKingOfAngmar,True,2019-05-22 09:58:00,6.148,VHC ASM tomorrow As usual Im there Im expecting to hear one really great piece of news As far as the CAFC still not expecting to hear anything out of them until late June early July I know sucks but what does not about the way the courts have treated us Still think this problem that came up is going to be remember come next trail Somebody is in deep shit I keep repeating my mantra 120unit cash
