Boss530,False,2019-05-22 15:16:00,4.28,GALT
uborcoli,,2019-05-22 15:06:00,4.27,GALT stopage you are lying about the facts behind this rights offering and you know it I am reporting you for manipulation
StopaGE,False,2019-05-22 15:01:00,4.268,GALT If the bears chop through the large block of bids at 425 then this could sink under 400 If instead of oversubscribing to the RO Big Dick put 1M into buying more shares we would be over 500 No volume no buyers no support
StopaGE,False,2019-05-22 14:55:00,4.27,GALT Now at another new low And no one is selling today for RO funds as settlement wouldnt clear in time POFS
D_Coral,True,2019-05-22 13:37:00,4.3,GALT This is exactly what happens in the last couple days of an RO as participating shareholders swap their shares for RO units Shorts who have any street sense at all should cover now because starting tomorrow existing shareholders will be buying GALT shares on the open market instead of oversubscribing Youve been warned
Smallfishbigpond,,2019-05-22 13:37:00,4.3,GALT The stock wont find buyers above the expected VWAP price Pretty obvious
unoqualunqueroma,,2019-05-22 13:33:00,4.28,GALT whats wrong here
StopaGE,False,2019-05-22 13:29:00,4.283,GALT And yet another low of the day matching the low of the last 30 days Management is doing NOTHING
Scarliver,,2019-05-22 13:25:00,4.3,GALT RO will be oversubscribed This is too important an issue especially in NASH with competition failure Late stage NASH can bankrupt entire health care systems Nothing out there in any pipeline can halt progression to decompensated disease GALT is desperately needed
StopaGE,,2019-05-22 13:15:00,4.346,GALT Looking back at the one month chart and without doing any exact computations I am pegging the final VWAP in the 440450 range making the adjusted price in the 420425 range
Scarliver,,2019-05-22 13:08:00,4.342,GALT Blocked StopaGE or whatever that handle is Just couldnt take him anymore Worthless FPOS
Tiggerrrr,True,2019-05-22 13:02:00,4.344,GALT DAMN what a beautiful drop I aint gonna hate Lower the VWAP more shares for me since I oversubscribed Ahhhh feels nice to just get more shares Thanks DU from the bottom of my heart I know this is all a wonderful play in the making Takes greatness to recognize greatness Shorty u wouldnt understand that HANG TIGHT GANG this is just fan bleacher noise D
LAKEMARY,True,2019-05-22 12:28:00,4.35,GALT new Galectin inhibitors cant beat this due to cost to manufacture and the patents held here
LAKEMARY,,2019-05-22 12:11:00,4.37,GALT my take is a quiet period is in effect They cant prop the share price during the RO
ryans1984,,2019-05-22 12:07:00,4.34,GALT down again and again
LAKEMARY,,2019-05-22 12:05:00,4.34,GALT just completed a board cleanup
StopaGE,False,2019-05-22 11:54:00,4.375,GALT If they had good news then they would have released it to get the price up and more money from the RO Every day it goes down the less funds that the RO produces and this is the last day
StopaGE,False,2019-05-22 11:53:00,4.36,GALT And the nosedive accelerates POFS
Bygtyme,True,2019-05-22 11:49:00,4.373,GALT To us retail investors Back Bays performance thus far has been lackluster Mr Uihlein has praised their work There has to be good things going on behind the scenes or they would have been canned awhile ago
LAKEMARY,True,2019-05-22 11:42:00,4.33,GALT 100 5 Contracts October 18 2019 added
DingDong9,,2019-05-22 11:20:00,4.4,GALT can we get this thing above 5 after RO please
StopaGE,,2019-05-22 11:07:00,4.423,GALT Driving down the price of the RO right up to the last minute the VWAP for this cant be more than 460 or so x 95 so I am guesstimating less than 450
dmacw,True,2019-05-22 10:38:00,4.458,GALT Is this thing on
