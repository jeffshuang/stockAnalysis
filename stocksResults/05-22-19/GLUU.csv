BITKOIN4LIFE,,2019-05-22 14:50:00,8.508,GLUU OK Bought this dip Right here 850 It will swing back up Shaking the weak big this last week or 2 Just buy these dips sell the rips back up while keeping long position untouched The trades will keep you from making a bad emotional decision bc of volatility Take advantage of that volatility Fundamentally still bullish technically still bullish Last time I checked nothing much has changed Definitely nothing to be concerned over or that would justify this dip in SP I think MM want more are loading up on the cheap but I am biased I guess HODL
