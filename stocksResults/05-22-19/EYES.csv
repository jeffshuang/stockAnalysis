TradeOnTheWire,True,2019-05-22 13:43:00,0.8557,EYES insider buy last night after huge eps run like rw down here cheap bios been very hot and this one could go
Nostrildammus,False,2019-05-22 10:35:00,0.8375,EYES Once upon a time a big inside buy would be good for 10 or more and a little squeeze action but it happens so often and has for a long time that it makes no real impact anymore Still waiting for 80 or below for possible first entry for an eventual swing to a buck but not tempted here GL
