Maxemues,True,2019-05-22 13:04:00,28.243,STNE This looks like a healthy pullback thus far Weve squeezed up 4 over the last 2 days crossed up MACD and Bollinger The chart looks like its due for a run up unless some unforeseen BS happens lol ER was really strong and lets not forget they can begin the 200M Stock Buyback at anytime Once we break above 30 I think well have some very bullish momentum especially with that Gap fill to 34 We shall see But for now Im holding my position Looking for 40 might take 2 months but I definitely think thats possible by mid summer
