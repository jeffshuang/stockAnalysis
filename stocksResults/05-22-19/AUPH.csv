Neil_Armstrong,,2019-05-22 14:03:00,6.501,AUPH interesting event 2 cc in a row theyve mentioned maybe acquiring another drug company I think we should heed these hints
johntall,True,2019-05-22 13:23:00,6.48,AUPH The guy certainly seems normal enough but with a name like Peter Greenleaf I am pretty sure that he is part Hobbit Smurf or Elf
shorty44444,,2019-05-22 13:16:00,6.46,AUPH solid presentation huh
NoIamSpartacus,True,2019-05-22 13:01:00,6.47,AUPH HiIm Peter Greenleaf Wanna make money save lives Then I suggest you buy AUPHy by the truck load then let me handle the rest Questions Shouldnt be I just gave you all the answers
jarepeo,True,2019-05-22 12:53:00,6.478,AUPH I remember my craft arts teacher putting drops in his eyes about twice an hour and showing so much discomfort in doing so VOS needs to get their dosage dialed in but that once a day dose is looking to be a great selling point So by next Q we should see some direction yay
nomadb,True,2019-05-22 12:52:00,6.47,AUPH awe shit We green
JPatrick1,,2019-05-22 12:39:00,6.44,AUPH I like to trade on AUPH and was waiting for a drop of some significance but its holding up better than expected so I may need to stock up on shares for tomorrows action
IDrinkandKnowThings,True,2019-05-22 12:19:00,6.44,AUPH Good overview of milestones upcoming catalysts and overall health of the company I think Peter did well and highlighted the important things Might seem some action in SP over coming days as a result of this interview I also liked that he pointed out that they will be coming forward with more strategic direction of the company to be shared with the public in coming months Hope to see some movement soon
flyhigh7,True,2019-05-22 12:16:00,6.435,AUPH Feeling very good about my investment here Very smart of Glickman to hand over this company at this time Well played Glickman
flyhigh7,True,2019-05-22 12:14:00,6.432,AUPH I said it once I will say it againGreenleaf will bring in a bunch of new institutional investors Most likely all ready started He is the right man at the right time
IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-05-22 12:02:00,6.408,AUPH Just playing it back The interviewer sounds like a moron

LordDragon,True,2019-05-22 11:22:00,6.455,AUPH Firstly thanks to SteveTexans for sharing the webcast Secondly Peter is a sharp cat with possibly broader business experience than Gman esp in development commercialization Thirdly i suspect they will monetize VOS somehow to secure more nondilutive funding to support FSGSpotential VoC path to market if not acquired before They remain very focused on their targets

JPatrick1,,2019-05-22 11:02:00,6.47,AUPH I looked at the comment below and considered what would have to transpire for AUPH to reach 6500 and I am starting to realize that this company definitely has designed a substantial platform to allow this to happen
jarepeo,True,2019-05-22 10:51:00,6.49,AUPH I guess I can wait another 12 months when this gets to 6500
youcalledownthethunder,True,2019-05-22 10:47:00,6.49,AUPH they crushed
SteveTexans,True,2019-05-22 10:44:00,6.488,AUPH Greenleaf has excellent BF experience with commercialization and small cap with being acquired company for more than x48 value Excellent return on investment for shareholder value Well rounded former CEO and upper manager for other biotech firms His intro with his bio was impressive
flyhigh7,True,2019-05-22 10:38:00,6.478,AUPH Great explanations into the patient dosing
Derek1s,,2019-05-22 10:23:00,6.49,AUPH they admitted patients into the study that had biopsies from 2yrs ago in p3 trial vs 6 months in p2 trial
ElephantSeal,,2019-05-22 10:23:00,6.49,AUPH Better than average lol Probably not the best choice of words
JPatrick1,,2019-05-22 10:22:00,6.49,AUPH Easing back to the low 640s and might dip down to the 620s and stablilize Rueters considers AUPH a strong buy candidate at this level and I have to agree
flyhigh7,True,2019-05-22 10:21:00,6.49,AUPH He gave a great intro to his backgroundawesome
