W404,,2019-05-22 14:06:00,2.151,SFET that same MM did trash price last thursday while all buying was in the 235239 region hey fukced us up with a 100 share trade at 222 at 1559 and 1600
W404,True,2019-05-22 14:01:00,2.151,SFET managment should fire that MarketMaker nobody sold 100 shares at 206 he did better to have no trade for the day than to have that MM working for himself and probably buddies that create spikessell naked illegal short during those spikes and trash shareprice again to buy back
W404,,2019-05-22 12:41:00,2.16,SFET todays valuation should be already 6 to 10 netnut went from 08 to 22 million during 17 to 18 so its plausible they are doing 5million by years end Sfet did also land big decent contracts end of 2018 and recently that bigger ministry single vendor contract for 3 yearsthere is high demand for cybersecurity cause every company is more and more under attack
W404,True,2019-05-22 12:16:00,2.16,SFET arent there better companies out there to do their stockmanipulation really attacking a marketcap of 5 to 6 millionfully diluted with other company included when all financing deals are arranged of around 16 to 17 million marketcapthats NETNUT and new shares includedEvery guy does 3 year in military in IL and usually guys working in cybersecurity have ties with intelligence and army in that field also so I ask to that little group that manipulates this stockprice do you want to fukc with these guys over a few 100k here and there by manipulating the hell out of this even doing the effort to post on stocktwits with multiple aliases pretty dumb dumb dumb
W404,True,2019-05-22 12:00:00,2.16,SFET why do you think there is no real shortposition in this companyonly during spike a group does naked illegal shortselling and uses behaviour of daytraders to trigger their buying as well as their selling shortly thereafter they reverse position they dont want to keep shortposition of 50 or 100k for too long cause this company can release new decent contracts or partnerships any given dayManagement should look into this cause that groups caps their marketcap to ridiculous levels
W404,True,2019-05-22 11:20:00,2.16,SFET they used 100 shares to bring it to 206 while it closed higher in IL desperate last move to get as much as cheap shares before tomorrow they used last few weeks around the clock to get back cheap shares but that didnt work well nobody selling anymore
aphasma,,2019-05-22 11:10:00,2.16,SFET With all these high prospect the share price keeps falling It doesnt make sense
