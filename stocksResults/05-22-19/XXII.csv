Congostockchat,,2019-05-22 15:33:00,2.055,XXII let me give you my personal testimony as a highly addicted 30year smoker who managed to break free from that very evil product Smokers smoke because they are addicted Not because they want to stink Not because they want to burn holes in their clothes Not because they want to lay in bed and have a cigarette after sex Because they are addicted Our vln product will change the world Prepare for approval
Congostockchat,,2019-05-22 15:31:00,2.05,XXII of course Philip Morris saying they will be moving away from combustible cigs Because they dont have a VLN product Lol because they cannot get it through their mind that this whole heat not burn is going to go up in a cloud of vapor smoke They cannot find it in their hearts and souls to give up nicotine They will find though smokers everywhere are giving up nicotine They are not going to move to an easy bake oven nicotine factory
Congostockchat,True,2019-05-22 15:28:00,2.057,XXII let me explain something to you Back in the 1990s there was this computer memory that was released that was called rambus It was better then the current standard which was sdram It wound up failing though Big time To the point it was completely discontinued It is very hard and next to impossible even to dislodge something from the market that has become such a standard Iqos Will Fail The writing is already on the wall in places like Japan where it has already gone headtohead with combustible cigs And has gained only a 10 share of the market Big tobacco is going to become Peewee tobacco Prepare for approval
Congostockchat,,2019-05-22 15:20:00,2.05,XXII apparently Philip Morris is going to be 100 moving away from combustible tobacco Well judging by how well iqos does in Japan with a 10 market share apparently they will be giving 90 of their business to XXII then LOL

Congostockchat,,2019-05-22 09:46:00,2.03,XXII I think its interesting to contemplate whether XXII really made a mistake or not in not going for a PMTA originally This is from a FINANCIAL standpoint only From a health standpoint it would have greatly benefitted society to have that happen Lets consider though if they did and were approved Wed have a product with no label even to distinguish it from any other cig No marketing allowed to distinguish it It could have really strained XXII resources to even produce it much less to try to see it sold I think maybe the biggest thing would be would the FDA have then felt compelled to even pursue the all tobacco VLN initiative XXII is clearly the centerpiece of that We ARE THE VLN INITIATIVE I feel like the FDA really worked closely with Henry to develop this plan of attack Think back on when the 1st app was sent backhenry bent over backwards to say to shareholderslistenthis is NOT a bad thing He knew what was coming IMO
