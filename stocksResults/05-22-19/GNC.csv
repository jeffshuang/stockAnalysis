robbi65,,2019-05-22 10:08:00,1.679,GNC 2 Insiders bought some shares at 186188 and this fell even further So I am guessing Insiders buying not helping much either My sympathy too Stay Strong bulls if there is any left here
txandco,False,2019-05-22 10:08:00,1.679,GNC Its sad when your stock moves up a few cents but youd rather it fall further bc the drop to zero is a shorter distance than the climb you need to recover Said all GNC bulls
