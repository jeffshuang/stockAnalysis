BigDip51,,2019-05-22 15:58:00,1.617,ADMP projections for tomorrow with ssr removes I say 140
BowenHardcase,,2019-05-22 15:28:00,1.62,ADMP seriously how can the generic version of an FDAapproved lifesaving product that has a high demand and short supply and is pretty much only available at pricegouging rates from a soulless monster of a company take TWO FING YEARS FROM APPROVAL TO LAUNCH HOW CAN YOU SO COMPLETELY F THAT UP
BowenHardcase,,2019-05-22 15:18:00,1.63,ADMP Carlo is not some super savvy businessman thats going to take the world of generic pharmaceuticals by storm Hes a buffoon Symjepi is not some topsecret product destined to shake the very foundations of allergy treatment no matter how little effort Mark puts into doing PR We few on this board are not the enlightened We are not only ones blessed with the knowledge of Adamis and generic epinaloxone products The rest of the market knows and their opinion is well reflected in the current SP Carlo is Mr Magoo Adamis is a scam and the one ones who make money here are shorts scalpers and management
KeepRollin,,2019-05-22 15:13:00,1.62,ADMP 5 Mill in compounding loss 5 4 Quarters 20MILLION The remaining 12 Million in salary and perks And the actual amount spent on growth 4 Mill Now its even simple Since no product in the pipeline everything goes in their pocket
KeepRollin,,2019-05-22 15:09:00,1.626,ADMP The last One year Expense went where As per FDA tadalafil application wasnt even complete They dont produce Nax and Symject technology was already there So what happened to 32 Million for the year
KeepRollin,,2019-05-22 14:59:00,1.637,ADMP The fact that NDA for tadalafil and Nax were released 700 pm without any change in the price tell us that the Management already knew about tadalafil getting kicked out and Nax to receive a lawsuit The entire game is planned You can see big sales a day or two before the news It tanks every time Are you kidding me You own a product have a contract no money in the account yet you dont know the launch date Even the dumbest person can figure that pattern
Forthright,True,2019-05-22 14:57:00,1.635,ADMP To clarify why Adamis senior management are not buying stock is because they are and have been in a blackout period This I know for a fact
Murder_of_Crows,,2019-05-22 14:54:00,1.635,ADMP I was thinking not much happened in the last 52 weeks to move the stock from 510 to 165 Then I thought yes not much has happened Very few sales retarded roll out no urgency finger pointing to Sandoz who isnt talking Now I understand
User123321,,2019-05-22 14:50:00,1.63,ADMP Huge move so far today up 25 Joking of course but just to get to 3 requires a nearly 83 move from 164 and thats major appreciationThis is a sunken cost show with shit in front of it
robertejohnson,,2019-05-22 14:47:00,1.64,ADMP The shorts are full of shit these generic companies file all sorts of frivolous lawsuits every day They have no case
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 14:37:00,1.638,ADMP Personally I think drug company such as Kaleo should be banned permanently from selling drugs in the US because their disregard of human life by hiking opioid drug price 6 folds They should be banned forever selling drugs in the US or the rest of the world for that matter Kaleo is just like Mylan hiking life saving drugs price in order to profit more
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 14:34:00,1.623,ADMP I wish the judge of this case can see that Kaleo is clearly a crooked company and with the way they hike life saving opioid drug price over 600 in 4 years and being invesgated by Congress shows their dirty character On top of that their Evzio auto injector is not a manully pushding down by finger injector so what the hell is Kaleo talking about here They have no case here at all
wjgesq,,2019-05-22 14:33:00,1.623,ADMP Hope they dont think their defense attorneys will accept ADMP stock as a retainer
ElDonJuan,True,2019-05-22 14:32:00,1.62,ADMP NVS Hi Leslie Were ready for that juicy PR on symjepi retail and Junior launch
KeepRollin,,2019-05-22 14:26:00,1.63,ADMP so let me get this straight We will pay Management 9M this quarter to turn US compound around that only makes 4MILL in gross
Charlie_Buffett,,2019-05-22 14:24:00,1.63,ADMP Why do bears have to always be bashers Cant they just be bears with a thoughtful bearish thesis Not all Bulls are dreamers many have a long thesis
KeepRollin,,2019-05-22 14:23:00,1.63,ADMP You dont get sued left and right on every product unless you are really fuc up How can each attempt to go in vain unless its intentional1 Symjepi no retail launch2 Symjepi Jr vanished from the surface3 Inhalers are still sitting useless In a few years you will write them off 1004 US compound is far from breaking even Every 10 increase in revenue is followed by 20 in cost 5 Tadalafil is bagged6 Nax might have a conditional approval if any What is the company getting paid for now since there is nothing in the pipeline other than lawsuits
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 14:23:00,1.63,ADMP Drug company Kaleo raised price of lifesaving opioid overdose antidote more than 600 percentKen Alltucker USA TODAY usatodaycomstorynewshea
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 14:05:00,1.619,ADMP It seems our society become very corrupt with greedy folks in charge They dont care about lower drug price or saving patients lives All they care about is how to make big filthy quick money and monopoly the market so they can charge patients whatever ridiculous price they wish because there is no competitors or they try to blocked competitions from entering the market What a moral society we are living in today
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 14:01:00,1.62,ADMP Kaleos Evzio website demo evziocompatienthowtous
beachsidefreddy,,2019-05-22 14:01:00,1.62,ADMP SIR WOULD A DILLY BE IN YOUR FAVOUR I WILL ARRANGE IT
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 14:01:00,1.62,ADMP Compare Kaleos Evzio autoinjector website with Adamis Zimhi syringe Kaleos auto injector should have a spring inside that is why it is called auto injector that will pushes the needle out with the spring when press down the device on ones thigh area Adamis syringe you will need to mannaul push down the plunger with your fingers The injection machanism is very different
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 13:49:00,1.61,ADMP last time I checked auto injector has a spring inside that pushes out the solution but Adamis syringe is manually pushing down the plunger to inject solution It is not even the same thing What the f is Kaleo talking about
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 13:46:00,1.611,ADMP Maybe Adamis lawyers should point out that Kaleo pharm raised its naxolone auto injector price more than 600 from 670 in 2014 to 4500 in 2019 And currently Kaleo is being investigated by US senate for hiking drug prices What a shame this is
StankyPigano,,2019-05-22 13:44:00,1.615,ADMP NYMX TXMD For LT investors who like to buy dips these stocks have provided a virtual wonderland of opportunity past few months I remain convinced all will be multibaggers next few years Im mystified by TXMD actionproducts and launch strategies are great and execution has been flawless Low risk 5bagger next few years imho NYMX is still risky but BPH drug should be a blockbuster when approved And ADMP probably turns the corner when partner Sandoz launches Symjepi to compete with EpiPen next few weeks Glta longs
Jeff2222222,,2019-05-22 13:42:00,1.615,ADMP Pharos companies nowadays are like law firms they dont care about patients or cheaper drug price all they want is more money Or market share
StankyPigano,True,2019-05-22 13:36:00,1.615,ADMP Fwiw stock is now trading at 50 of my estimated value for Symjepi USC alone Symjepi value is 1597M based on 42M aggregate annual scripts 1 script growth 20 peak market share 125 net revenue per unit 50 net margin and royalty 50 of net income Discount rate is 10 USC 30M value is obtained from RayJays estimate These are conservative estimates and include nothing for naloxone tadalafil or inhalers Pick your spots buy and wait imho
URMessinUp,,2019-05-22 13:24:00,1.61,ADMP I ALMOST BOUGHT MORE WHEN THIS HIT 2 THEN GOT REAL CLOSE TO PULLING THE TRIGGER ON SOME 185 BUT I JUST KEPT TELLING MYSELF THE TRUTH WHEN YOU THINK ADMP WONT GET ANY LOWER IT ALWAYS DOES ON BIG BLOCKS IT GETS UNREAL AT 10AM
BowenHardcase,,2019-05-22 13:01:00,1.61,ADMP If Carlo were competent or even cared about SH just a little he would have Mark putting out PR right now during trading to address lawsuit situation and reiterate that everything is moving forward unhindered by pending litigation which they feel is frivolous and without merit They would point out these cases are common and that drug companies still do business as usual like partnerships sales while these kind of patent disputes are ongoing But Carlo is a moron and shorts will eat this alive as soon as they can Ive never seen a company so unwilling to foster their SP and protect investors With such little PR effort this couldve still been 5 This is why I bash And why Ive made a lot of money shorting and scalping here

Astroboy56,True,2019-05-22 12:41:00,1.62,ADMP insiders are restricted by the company to buy shares of ADMP stock Restrictions can be lifted and the insiders will be able to buy at that time Buying restrictions were a good practice when shares were being given as bonuses but now there is no need to restrict unless they know the naxolone is being approved or they know the launch date of Sandoz etc Adamis needs to be careful as any company does when employees are buying stock because they may know something others do notAdamis is looking doesnt mean it will happen at opening up stock purchasing by employees Have a fantastic day

retire4me,,2019-05-22 11:56:00,1.6,ADMP Would Sandoz announce a public launch or do I need to keep looking for the Symjepi truck unloading at my local Walgreens
AncientAlien2,,2019-05-22 11:52:00,1.59,ADMP Fact is if this goes toward a buck someone will gun to take it over no debt and crazy product assets here quite frankly we are near fire sale prices already could get wild with so many retail shares outstanding would be pretty easy to gain a 50 stake under 3 bucks
