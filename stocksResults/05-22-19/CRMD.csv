JackNapier22,True,2019-05-22 15:47:00,7.15,CRMD Im also fine with a capital raise after this takes off as long as the strategy to commercialize makes sense
JackNapier22,True,2019-05-22 15:45:00,7.17,CRMD The real decision wont be whether to sell anytime soon it will be what to do when this hits 1520 share To me that is pretty inevitable but from there it could really suffer if they have a clueless approach to bringing this to market My hope is that a partnership with someone big comes about in advance of shareholders having to make that decision

btdb,,2019-05-22 14:34:00,7.232,CRMD cash to middle next year which means they have to raise about 6 months earlier They have lots of shares available due to the rs Waiting on FDA They think they are a strong management team you cant make this sht up Khoso hired in 2016 Strong Neutrolin result and hopefully able to file at least for hemodialysis on the one trial

btdb,,2019-05-22 13:18:00,7.116,CRMD Were in the rs aftermath The shorts correctly interpreted managements selfinflicting wound and crunched the company at a time when there are no buyers While they waved the Tute flag of they need a 5 buck minimum this wasnt the reason for the rs it was to create shares that were contracted and needed Tutes wont line up here due to the lack of Wall Street relationships and poor fiscal management aka their double warrant raise If youre here as a long youre here because you believe they can shepherd Neutrolin to the finish line I think they can but they have done some questionable things and arent sharp managers
