Icarium,,2019-05-22 15:57:00,3.43,SND taking a starting position Will look to add between now and 300
BitcoinBear,,2019-05-22 14:18:00,3.502,Will not even think of being back into HCLP until after actual conversion takes place It could drop to 020 and I wouldnt touch it After the conversion we will take another lookI know management has said there is no tax risk in the conversion but in the spirit of the Italian mafia why take a chance Ill let someone else handle the risk and will hide out in other sand names CVIA SLCA SND
BitcoinBear,,2019-05-22 14:02:00,3.48,HCLP the thing I currently dislike most is the number of investors talking last mile last mile last mile I get it That is what Rasmus has been touting all along but how many quietly noticed the missing slide in the Q1 2019 presentation on their last mile crews In Q4 they report 8 crews for silos and 16 crews for boxes In Q1 they removed the decided slide showing longterm growth of last mile and instead included the number by itself in another slide That numbers was 4 silos and 9 boxes That isnt lastmile growth Today HCLP is vastly overpriced compared to sand yesterday and its peers CVIA SND SLCA
BitcoinBear,,2019-05-22 13:22:00,3.473,100 out of HCLP on this wide disconnect from rest of sand Surely this is just because a few more people buying on event news today Buy the rumor sell the news in play with HCLP Sell while you can Possibly even some sells from SND SLCA CVIA But I took HCLP monies and converted down into CVIA in 28X
