THEREALSIA,,2019-05-22 13:16:00,0.865,INSY does not look pretty but if this stays and closes above 090 would be a positive move Very frustrating that no one from the company giving statements I hope this steers away from where it is today and one day we can get back to 1011 I know many including myself have lost so much in this POS that the management needs to get their shit together and pull it together I am not sure why they have to pay for the court costs and why they decided to go in bribery I would not have invested in them if there was a chance they are being shady
THEREALSIA,True,2019-05-22 12:58:00,0.875,INSY i think no matter what stock you are holding looks like we are fucked for long time Brace yourself Hold on tight and hopefully we be ok in 6 months to one year I think we are in dire need of change with our country It is a shame our country is so divided and we can not get along no matter what Really hope INSY gets their shit together and reward the shareholders and not fuck them
