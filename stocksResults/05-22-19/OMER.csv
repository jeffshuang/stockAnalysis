Stellar_Capital,True,2019-05-22 15:54:00,18.963,OMER I purchased another 5000 shares today I finally got around to reviewing all of the 10Q I have been traveling I think sub20 is a steal I also have the luxury of most shares cost avg around 1415 I say it sure is funny to look back 3 years ago at some of the bullish sentiment when this was priced at 27 and beyond Those poor souls probably got burned and sold out PS I watched Wall Street for the first time on the flight home Maybe that will be us but without the insider trading part

chaddeus,True,2019-05-22 15:25:00,18.95,OMER Know the risks look at a chart Consider the upside also If were right about Narso youre looking at a multibillion dollar company not a heavy lift at all Then theres the real bull case which we neednt concern ourselves with now We can revisit that pending certain confirmations on Narso
Stellar_Capital,True,2019-05-22 14:45:00,18.919,OMER if youre very conservative OMER is worth about 15B on OMIDRIA alone no pipeline If youre aggressive OMER is worth between 400 and 800 a share 510 years out I like owning this company because the pipeline doesnt have to pan out for this to be a safe play They already have an approved drug Market isnt doing the math JCODE shows CMS is viewing OMIDRIA as a drug now not a surgical supply From this we can assume that permanent passthrough will follow My two cents Dont sue me
gless3940,True,2019-05-22 14:29:00,18.85,OMER I dont believe the company or its research people expect bad news They have been hiring employees to take them to the next step as if approval is in hand Unless something really unexpected by the company and the FDA happens then I believe it is full steam ahead no stops

Dollarsforboats,True,2019-05-22 11:06:00,18.606,OMER presentations are NOT the place to reveal news Its a way for companies to talk about their pipeline I guess the meaningful updated part was the on track to break record sales in this quarter as well Thats actually very important as Omidria continues to gain traction Also it seems to me that they are starting to prioritize the oncology platform GPR174 sounds very promising with Tcells suppression but a long way out Look for a PR soon if you want to be excited about news

redlumremo,True,2019-05-22 10:02:00,19.062,OMER Thanks jozeknoze for the catalyst for moving on up since you started spewing your half truths if that Omer is up 33 percent You are a better catalyst than good data Keep it up the more you spew the higher we go maybe you can launch us to new highs Damn I love this guy
