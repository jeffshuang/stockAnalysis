Ballinnn,,2019-05-22 12:51:00,1.39,AGRX watch her for closing imo she is promising a good spike Im already in and swinging it see my posts from hours ago
Bee202,True,2019-05-22 12:35:00,1.393,AGRX IMO Until the 111619 ruling there will be nothing that will dramatically move this stock There may be 5 8 updown swings you could try to trade watch out for low volume but again nothing major until rulingRemember this is an ALL or NOTHING play that is based solely on Twirla being approvedMy suggestion is to watch the Institutional Investor and Shorts percentages If news get leaked you mayshould see movement here Currently they are at 5453 178Again an all or nothing play that wont be known until NovemberGood luck

acricketeer,,2019-05-22 10:39:00,1.405,AGRX A little disappointing considering the speed in which the FDA responded At least it accelerates the timeline
