kw30,True,2019-05-22 15:43:00,9.995,TSLA for sure sexy cars for sure made the electric cars go from nerdy to cool no denying that I think the comparisson and rivalry building with F is not really a fair one Sure Ford is expanding in Tech and EV but TSLA has years of practice ahead of Ford so it will take Ford or anyone else a while to match tech with design like TSLA However Ford will have the upper hand in actual showrooms since tesla is getting rid of theirs so ppl can actually test them out and get them serviced in considerably more locations For folks like me who need something to drive around on the off road cant really depend on TSLA for that altho looks good in office garage BUT ONE of the COOLEST advantages is when F finally reveals and produces the much loved and missed BRONCO This pic is from a car show and its the concept F has the advantage of nostalgia and that is a powerful and beautiful thing
