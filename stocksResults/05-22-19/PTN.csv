LDio,True,2019-05-22 11:21:00,1.56,PTN My biggest problem here really is that Im only 95 certain about approval it seems kind of silly for me to sell some before the FDA decision just to be on the safe side but the simple fact is 95 just aint 100 As far as when to sell the question really is just about timing has nothing to do really with price as long as its in the right time frame which is the week before approval
Slowgallop,,2019-05-22 11:20:00,1.548,PTN Noting a number of negative postings encouraging others to sell Why would they bother to urge shareholders to sell what do they get out of thatexcept lower priced shares to buy themselves See this chorus often as a PDUFA approaches Thought the AMAG webcast was informative and positive I like the focused marketing approach and the fact that patients can go to regular health care clinicians not just specialsts for evaluation and that the qualifying criteria is limited to five simple questions This can streamline the introduction of Vyleesi to the market

TheDuke64,True,2019-05-22 11:07:00,1.52,PTN AMAG I thought that was a great presentation on Vyleesi from what they could legally comment on The marketing facts were very strong and they are doing a WAY better job at spreading the word for HSDD Looks like their sales and marketing strategy is sound Already in labeling negotiations with FDA Really looking forward to the PDUFA date soon again my prediction is that we get an early decision by the FDA
