MRKEE,,2019-05-22 15:59:00,1.125,TRCH So yesterdays action was not shorts Really Yesterdays volume was twice 10 day average volume Today was half 10 day average volume and less than a quarter of yesterdays volume I suppose investors decided to sell off on good news yesterday but today they are not so worried

MRKEE,,2019-05-22 10:33:00,1.19,TRCH So shorts had to significantly increase their risk for a 10 cent paper gain and thats before they try to cover Only takes one leak or rumor and the day traders will pile back in
Breakoutking,,2019-05-22 10:31:00,1.19,TRCH WHERES THE OIL I will say it again LOL
