Afuel,True,2019-05-22 14:52:00,1.662,KMPH so basically Mickle was asked about KP415 and when the expectation of a deal was going to be He answered distinctively about late June early July He said it has been a long drawn out process which will end at that time period I believe he mention that the partner wanted to sure up some things with the NDA which is at the end of June as well He was asked about other products produced by KemPharm and said decisions on those other drugs will be decided once the partner is in place If I am wrong on this someone please correct me
