enterprising,True,2019-05-22 15:00:00,1.004,LTBR they need to announce fries with the burger and a large soda
brianb3,,2019-05-22 14:31:00,1.01,LTBR What combination of announcements would have to come out together or at least in quick succession to make you decide to hold for a longer term 5 years
fred54,,2019-05-22 13:46:00,1.01,LTBR best chart LTBR has had in since before JV announced
anonimbus,True,2019-05-22 12:37:00,1,LTBR Price action looks good today we might actually close above 1 today
fred54,,2019-05-22 12:03:00,0.9939,LTBR the golden cross now in effect this is either gonna explode or dump in our faces given its LTBR prepare for the latter but Im buying dips
IndianTech,,2019-05-22 10:32:00,1,LTBR hi all can someone kindly discuss revenue potential and timetable for sales Thinking of opening a long position
MyBullRun,,2019-05-22 10:32:00,1,LTBR Not sure how Bradley moving to Framatone and Donweck becoming CFO at the JV makes a difference I would imagine this appears to be kind of a promotion for BradleyI have seen a lot of companies give promotions to execs just to phase them out Is this what is happening with Bradley Are they moving him to an area where it is just a title and eventually he will be given the ax
ECerus,,2019-05-22 10:31:00,1,LTBR Now blocking jimmienoman or whoever he is Like to his his kindergarten report card
Arpeggio,,2019-05-22 10:27:00,1,LTBR lolas an ER doc change in CFO wouldnt have meant much to megreatly appreciate all the business acumen on this board
tradeintherain,,2019-05-22 10:13:00,1.015,LTBR First short to panic wins Be afraid
jimmienoman,,2019-05-22 10:03:00,0.9929,LTBR hey you long termers Is it sad Im pumping the brakes on this because knowing Seths personality this may just be a scheme of his I mean he may be thinking to himself Hey we are going to get this huge grant and utility contracts any moment now whats the first thing we should do I know well need a Great CFO when that happens So he goes and hires a new CFO expecting his timeline will come to fruition in months In reality the timeline is years
ECerus,,2019-05-22 10:03:00,0.9929,LTBR Imagine Framatome can almost have their pick of CFOs BOLD and thoughtful move Both CFO positions will pay long term dividends
tradeintherain,,2019-05-22 09:59:00,0.99,LTBR Where is this big mountain of shit sitting on us coming from to keep us under 1 Who would sell
tradeintherain,,2019-05-22 09:55:00,0.99,LTBR OMG Fred said bullish Mark this day
tradeintherain,,2019-05-22 09:53:00,0.99,LTBR Keep that book clean Gene Dont be a moneychanger
fred54,,2019-05-22 09:53:00,0.99,LTBR the way grant process works is DOE can seek clarification from cos submitting Im sure prior to disbursement they wanted a CFO who would oversee expenditures I think bullish and they got huge grant
tradeintherain,,2019-05-22 09:52:00,0.9899,LTBR So Enfission is going to have some money to count soon OK
BusinessClass,,2019-05-22 09:48:00,0.9839,LTBR for a moment I thought Enfission had a new CEO
ECerus,,2019-05-22 09:47:00,0.9835,LTBR Sit back and imagine how long and what discussions took place for a CFO change Huge Confidence shown on both sides of the JV This might be better than the StarbucksPepsi very successful JVNobody moves CFOs about without great strategic meaning Sure they dismiss a few but this is rarefied waters Long term success here It has been written
ECerus,,2019-05-22 09:39:00,0.99,LTBR Great subtle move Maybe I can end my 97 rant MaybeDont see that symbiosis very often
Mpete,True,2019-05-22 09:35:00,0.99,LTBR THIS IS BIG for a DOE grant
