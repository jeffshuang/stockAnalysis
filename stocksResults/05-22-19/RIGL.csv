jcrockett870,True,2019-05-22 13:28:00,2.078,RIGL the boat is taken over by shorts bears and pessimists I smell a loading zone
I_Still_Like_Beer,,2019-05-22 13:02:00,2.07,RIGL had to reduce my position here money to be made elsewhere
pandffan,,2019-05-22 11:46:00,2.06,RIGL there have to be some institutions that have seen more than a fifty percent decline in just the past year and are heading for the door as the chart starts to get uglier and uglier
I_Still_Like_Beer,,2019-05-22 11:38:00,2.061,RIGL if this doesnt move after EMA approval in Q3Q4 Im done with this company if that isnt going to move it than nothing will
pandffan,,2019-05-22 11:34:00,2.068,RIGL and just as I wrote my prior message the graphs diverge this is the whackiest stock Ive ever seen it doesnt seem to have any real underlying value
pandffan,,2019-05-22 11:28:00,2.097,look at a graph of RIGL today and a graph of todays DJIA or IBB or XBI its the basically same graph there are options on this 2 stock as well pray there isnt another 500 point blowoff in the Dow anytime soon
I_Still_Like_Beer,,2019-05-22 11:11:00,2.094,RIGL welp looks like my prediction yesterday is gonna be right
