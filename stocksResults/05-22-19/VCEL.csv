FoolIggy,,2019-05-22 13:16:00,15.515,VCEL level2 ASK sees no limit of being 3x BID Only reinforces that MMs Tutes shorts playing their games No big orders in the BID side compared to what has sold off recently Looks like SP of 14 within easy reach wiping out 2019 gains
FoolIggy,,2019-05-22 12:49:00,15.67,VCEL RSI5 20 50 200 all RED and could easily wipe out 2019 gain and drop back below 2018 highs IF low vol trend continues Patience for retail investors as time to buy in my opinion is NOT yet Hang on to ur shares let MMs play until right time
FoolIggy,,2019-05-22 12:40:00,15.645,VCEL MMs could also be working down for potential wannabe buyer to purchase additional shares to BUILD THEIR STOCK VAULT b4 making public offer Retail must be patient be ready to dble dwn right point Great business with great product means long term growthbuyout
no1patfan,True,2019-05-22 12:37:00,15.63,VCEL Ordinarily Id be crude and say cocksuckers are running us to low 15s just because they have techs on there side for the moment But then I say Ill be happy to double down at that price
FoolIggy,,2019-05-22 12:37:00,15.63,VCEL low vol means MMs Tutes manipulate to benefit large stock moves Insiders buy 3sh means lots of trades shorts to drive down further Guess is will fall below 14 for MMs Shorts Tutes to continue their magic
