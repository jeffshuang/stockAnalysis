ShipperPro,True,2019-05-22 13:08:00,1.1,GLBS DCIX TOPS DRYS YRIV DCIX is looking good Technically it should run to 150160 soon
doogie06,,2019-05-22 13:00:00,1.1,DCIX AlsoKeep in mind a few things about the buyback 1 It is slightly disappointing that the company hasnt purchased shares at this level 2 It is super encouraging that the stock has maintained its range without buyback 3 If the company decided to use just 50 of the buyback over the next 2 months we would solidly break above 125 IMO
doogie06,,2019-05-22 12:57:00,1.1,DCIX Keep in mind that this stock up 70 for the year It is now in a trading range with what looks like a lower end of 104 and upper end of 125The lower end is protected by 2 things1 Liquidation value of 2252 Potential buyback to avoid NASDAQ notice The upper end will be limited UNTIL mgmt does something to unlock value tender offer buyback merger 13D filing etc OR shipping rates go up The insurance policy for this company in terms of share price going down is the 17MM in cash 4 ships and no debt Im a buyer in the 104111 range Picked up 13K shares today at 110
pelic12,True,2019-05-22 11:42:00,1.09,DCIX Without Kalani and the Buyback not starting this will stay trading in the 108120 range like its been for the past month
