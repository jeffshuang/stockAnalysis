DavidOrr,,2019-05-22 10:53:00,0.93,FPAY I didnt mention it in my article But there might be a big pricing gap between the warrants FPAYW and the common If the common goes to 4 the warrants at the current price pay out more than 101 What might be happening here is people are shorting the common long the warrants for a hedging strategy Long term holders might consider picking up the warrants If that idea is true closing this gap would cause the hedging strategy to disappear and stop putting downward pressure on the common from shorts
Daedalus77,,2019-05-22 10:49:00,0.93,FPAY Im all out for now Ill pick it back up closer to earnings because its not hard to guess the results I have a rule about not being in low liquidity stocks that I have to follow during times like these

IrishGreen,,2019-05-22 09:53:00,0.945,FPAY Still holding here I think the payoff is getting very close here Also looking at PTI and ELGX as possible investment opportunities in the near term
