lukeam,True,2019-02-21 12:08:00,1.03,SDLP Seriously anyone want to offer a counterargument as to why this ISNT oversold leveledstable due for a bounce Seems so obvious
lukeam,True,2019-02-21 11:25:00,1.03,SDLP In my opinion any movement staying over 100 is bullish and if 100 was to crackIm no longer interested That simple
lukeam,True,2019-02-21 11:23:00,1.03,SDLP Still have order for more sitting at 101 if these big bids at 103 ever go away This stock has just been so stable for a month now
lukeam,True,2019-02-21 10:37:00,1.031,WTER Not a bad lil jump for 10 mins The easy low risk trades add up I like when RiskReward is calculated Still holding SDLP

gochip,,2019-02-21 10:00:00,1.035,SDLP In 103 been watching for a whileoversold stable outlook
lukeam,True,2019-02-21 09:57:00,1.038,SDLP 40000 bid at 103 seconds after my 102 entry too
lukeam,True,2019-02-21 09:56:00,1.03,SDLP Im in Added half 102 since I dont mind losing 2 if its going to crack 101 entry is absolute no brainer confidence play IMO
