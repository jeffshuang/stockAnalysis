ohshit,,2019-05-31 10:10:00,0.6259,TBLT that big ol RED 300 on the DOW is probably not helping either
Iledes01,,2019-05-31 10:09:00,0.6259,TBLT My perspective is dont buy unless there are clear signs of reversal and by clear signs I mean have confirmation that the warrants have all been converted have at least 2 consecutive green candles have the stock trading above the SMA5 when a stock is in uptrend the SMA5 is a good support when it is in downtrend the SMA5 becomes a resistance the SMA5 today is at 69 Then it is safe to invest otherwise it becomes a guessing game and catching a falling knife Back at the end of December when it had a good bounce it showed clear signs of reversal two consecutive green candles and trading above SMA5 It traded consistently above SMA5 from December 8th to January 24th since then it has traded below SMA5
