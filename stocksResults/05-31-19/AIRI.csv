joshfkntaylor,,2019-05-31 13:09:00,1.053,My favorite stocks in this meltdown are CBRE AVAV AIRI IRM Does anyone object to any of these All pinions welcome down an average of 7 since the meltdown
TI7812,True,2019-05-31 12:51:00,1.053,AIRI Put in a Bid 5k AON 102 Got a ton of stock 130k sh so none of these filling w a couple share bs for me
TI7812,,2019-05-31 10:02:00,1.072,AIRI SWAG on how MMs work First trade at 930 am was 4200 at 107 must have been prearranged not on Level II quoting systems cause the Bid right up to the open was lower BTW total vol yesterday was 8482 So in one trade half of yesterdays volume already trade Thats what one means by thinly traded All of this is noise as many have said including me Its all about YOY quarterly revs and earnings over the next quarters 2Q19 in August is my guess
