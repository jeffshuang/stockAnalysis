PULM,,2019-05-31 10:27:00,1.02,PULM doesnt YET meet the characteristics that are nearly always present when a stock like this makes a sustained move or any move for that matter but the last 5 weekly bars have been constructive in that regard HOWEVER it may still want to shake out at 092c but the weekly PA has wedged itself into a kind of spring but well let THEM identify what they are going to do and IF they want to take this up above 117125 and HOLD that level we would be looking for tests of the lower end of that level to enteradd
