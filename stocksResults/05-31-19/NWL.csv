stockguy20,,2019-05-31 10:21:00,13.085,NWL I hate to say this but its almost an unbuyable stock at all There is apparently no bottom You cant wait for a sign of a rebound because any good news is immediately sold off followed by new lows Q1 call is a perfect example Seemingly good progress report No dividend cut asset sales completed and a Q1 beat and reaffirmed full year guidance And here we areapproaching 10 year lows
