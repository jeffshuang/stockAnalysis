ajmuss,True,2019-05-31 13:02:00,1.518,LPCN picked up a few thousand more shares on each account My average is around 136 ps I will take advantage of the manip even I dont agree with it Large funds that trade LPCN at loss is not noticed due to its tiny amount of shares as they shake out weak hands for their personal gain Many fund managers get rich thanks to fund investors which is BS Sucks but may as well turn to my own advantage
