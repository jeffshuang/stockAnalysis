gregt8262,,2019-05-31 15:50:00,6.551,ACB Welp this is officially back to where it was before the peltz announcement HEXO is below where it was at the time Bank of America called it the best pot stock and gave it a 10 dollar valuation APHA was just given an 11 dollar valuation like 7 days ago and was called the gem of the marijuana market My friends we all got fucked

Bandar1978,True,2019-05-31 15:26:00,6.587,PLUG ADMA BIOC APHA MAXR I hate to say it The matter of the fact is due to Trumps announcement about the tariffs resulting in crashing the markets However I advise each and everyone not to sell because I strongly believe the markets will rise again within a few months from now Remember selling now lose but holding your shares gaining It is a matter of time MAN UP and be patient and dont mix your emotions with whats going on right now

PatLA818,,2019-05-31 15:21:00,6.578,APHA This is setting up like DecJan when the Pot sector was in the tank It may get just as bad with Trade wars but Pot is NOT a tariff comodity so it prob wont take as big a beating Some of these like HEXO OGI APHA ACB CTST were above 8910 when the TrumpTariff war started so no reason to think in a few weeks or months this will be back up Either dump and wait for bottoms to reenter or hold and add on dips like today
