Glopolon,,2019-05-31 09:59:00,0.8869,SCON Most companies will wait the first 180 day grace period to try to regain 100 Seeing as these guys are at 090 it would be foolish to RS now 180 days and one solid PR is all they need
Glopolon,,2019-05-31 09:58:00,0.8869,SCON A company can go to OTC as well it has happened recently with NLST Instead of a RS they went OTCQX and are fine otcmarketscomstockNLSTo
Glopolon,,2019-05-31 09:56:00,0.8869,SCON No way a company will not reverse split once they get a NASDAQ warning Stop pushing that nonsense They dont need to they never have
