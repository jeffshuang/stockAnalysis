commoncentsinvestor,,2019-05-31 14:19:00,1.905,SENS CoolRunning anyone else who is interested in SENS stock NO this is not a management problem And NO this is not a product problem Management has actually done a great job in taking Eversense through FDA approval getting adequate funding and initiating a good training marketing program The only thing holding the share price back from achieving its potential which could be as much as a 25 bagger is securing adequate coverage from the big insurance companies And because of that they have had to institute a program that basically subsidizes new users That is costly and will have a negative effect on short term revenues But adding those users now will end up being very profitable when the insurance coverage comes through AND IT WILL So no one should buy now if they are only looking for a quick profit It could happen if someone like United Healthcare announced coverage tomorrow But it is a great time to accumulate cheap shares for potential eventual great gains
