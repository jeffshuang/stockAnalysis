JAMES2052,,2019-05-31 14:30:00,148.303,BABA Unless China comes to reasonable terms that are a benefit not only to America but as well all the world nations these effects will continue as the world is sick of being bullied and pushed around in unfair trade in import and export and manufacturing with China and Trump has woken the world up to just how much China relies on them to sustain themselves They refuse to come to reasonable terms mark this post BABA by 3rd 14 will be 110 IMO Maybe sooner if those in the habit wake up to the reality of the change sooner
