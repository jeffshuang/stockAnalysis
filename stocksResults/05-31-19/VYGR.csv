WarmingTrend,,2019-05-31 11:08:00,21.507,SRPT This has to be said again Is anybody witnessing this OKTA It was 26 in Jan 18 Went over 100 Today up almost 12 to new all time highs 11850 Why Because they lost a shade less than expected But heres the best part The company has never made money There is no indication they will ever make money So what happens All sorts of analyst upgrades today And of course going straight to the targets That said enough is enough ignoring a SRPT target of 250 and sitting at 115 Or QURE target of 175 and sitting at 57 Or VYGR 64 and sitting at 21 These three being the Top 3 Buyout candidates in the entire biotech sector Or for that matter ROKU target 120 and we just cant take it there unless it proves us something OKTA is called The Billion Dollar Unicorn and its proven one thing People are idiots until they prove you wrong
