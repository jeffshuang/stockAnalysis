Stuart60611,,2019-05-31 14:15:00,47.54,EBIX Todays big drop which was much larger than broader market smells big time like shorts just piling on when its a down Friday based on scary tariff news knowing that there will be little buying and risking holding over the weekend Shorts spent a lot of dry powder today shorting at these low levels on the eve of what could be a historic acquisition that the market is very likely going to love Hard to see how shorts dont get killed here when the YTRA deal is announced
Stuart60611,,2019-05-31 14:00:00,47.48,Note that during this down day and with EBIX down big today and much more than broader market YTRA has been up the entire day and up as much as 1 where it is trading well above the share price prior to when EBIX made its acquisition offer This is a tell that the deal is still very much alive
