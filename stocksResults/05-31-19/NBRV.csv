keremoner,,2019-05-31 09:44:00,2.296,CPRX actually my thesis is that what is viewed as bad news for the economy in general such as trade wars effect certain stocks less Those would be what might be viewed as potentially undervalued stocks and value stocks including certain biotechs that are at critical junctions where their revenues are likely to explode soon and disruptors like LC Money that is fleeing directly affected stocks everything from Apple to Ford has only the options of lower yield investments or value stocks as well as certain biotechs I believe likes of CPRX and NBRV are just such companies Hang in there and we will be rewarded soon
