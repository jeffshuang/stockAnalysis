Mattastic75,,2019-05-31 15:04:00,6.46,AUPH very skeptical of this move by ILJN If they had the best interests of all shareholders in mind I dont think they would need to resort to these tactics Their base cost was deeply discounted so they can make serious money shorting and leaving us all holding the bag
HarryPopotter,,2019-05-31 14:54:00,6.468,AUPH some death money here
timfris,,2019-05-31 14:44:00,6.46,AUPH ILJIN if you want controlling interest of company start buying shares I got some available right now for 20 a share
jeff14,,2019-05-31 14:43:00,6.461,AUPH bad market day calls for some wizard staffs and lotr

HyacinthCohen,True,2019-05-31 14:29:00,6.48,AUPH omg I dont know which way to vote Too much information is withheld I want to know what iijn wants to do that the other dont agree with and it sounds like they cant give out that information So confusing
johndoe16,True,2019-05-31 14:27:00,6.48,AUPH ILJIN was invested when company was Isotechnika they were diluted into basically no value just like all investors Isotechnika under Fosters watch even tried to cut them out of the new company and there were lawsuits Voclosporin has a long history and I cant blame them for wanting to monetize the asset
Labelguy1122,True,2019-05-31 14:09:00,6.49,AUPH buy the bounce
IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-05-31 14:07:00,6.495,AUPH Ok lets see the bounce now

Smoothmoves1,,2019-05-31 13:50:00,6.53,AUPH dont go under 65
Lunacy,,2019-05-31 13:43:00,6.526,AUPH We caught wind of ILJINs intention to change up the board a couple months ago I believe around the time they increased their position again My first thought is that it is likely related to VoS given the timing Im now inclined to think its more about funding moving forward This is a quote from the shareholder letter and it really stands out to meWe believe a robust balance sheet is critical to achieving our goals and we have made significant efforts in this area the last few yearsSo maybe the disagreements are about the various funding pathways moving forwardand they dont want to be diluted anymore Perhaps they werent happy with the latest ATM or maybe howwhen they monetize VoSI would like to see ILJINs letter to shareholders but right now Ill stick with Aurinia and dont think a 15 shareholder should have controlling interest The letter also states we will get more information in time and insight to Auphs stance on these moves by ILJIN

SteveTexans,True,2019-05-31 12:39:00,6.54,AUPH Has anyone received email with control number yet for voting I have yet to received

Mattastic75,,2019-05-31 12:10:00,6.571,AUPH holding up nicely on a rough day for the market
jeff14,,2019-05-31 12:06:00,6.556,AUPH Shareholder really had to go out and complicate things for us

IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-05-31 11:39:00,6.589,AUPH I am going to go with what we know works and vote Yellow as recommended d1io3yog0oux5cloudfrontne
jarepeo,True,2019-05-31 11:18:00,6.63,AUPH Its apparent to me that Aurinia is getting some very serious offers I can also understand the current board wanting to bring VOC and VOS to the boiling point I am sure I would be completely happy somewhere in the middle at 4377
johndoe16,,2019-05-31 11:16:00,6.63,AUPH For me to vote for ILJIN I need to know why there unhappy with existing management and what there plans are
Daquirk,True,2019-05-31 11:02:00,6.64,AUPH a move above 68 today would end my week smashingly think Ill go do some yard work
IDrinkandKnowThings,,2019-05-31 10:14:00,6.63,AUPH holding well in a sea of red
IDrinkandKnowThings,True,2019-05-31 09:52:00,6.624,AUPH I see this as a non issue Whiny shareholder thinks they should be able to make decisions on how company is run End of day they just want to make big money like all of us
KeithKarnik,,2019-05-31 09:47:00,6.635,AUPH I trade on Fid and the way Auph put its description to them they seem to be against the new board additons
