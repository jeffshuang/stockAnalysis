Goupup,True,2019-05-31 14:11:00,6.42,CRMD Everyone who wants to sell is entitled to do so but remember next Monday is June 3 I think a good listener with few words is enough The socalled Tutes want the low price not because they are short but to seize your shares and go very long The price can change its tendency very fast and jump very high and you stay out Neutrolin will be approved because it is an excellent product and well wellproven Its just a matter of time You decide This is just a reminder a refresher of memory

BioStockDD,,2019-05-31 10:53:00,6.57,CRMD just watching but if they dont get their crap together that RS to get above 5 would for institutions to buy in would have been for nothing They need to finally state FDA accepted 1 trail and I have no doubt itll go right back to 12 Which is like 99 likely since they would have said no alreadySad to see many Longs gone and not even posting I get the frustration Good luck longs and bulls
