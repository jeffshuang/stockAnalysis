Scarliver,,2019-05-31 13:34:00,4,GALT Straightbite you then need to sell come back in 34 years in the meantime your negativity does nothing here I believe we are one major announcement in cancer from blowing the lid on this stock

Scarliver,,2019-05-31 13:26:00,4.01,GALT Straight bite our pessimistic long forgets the cancer immunooncology angle The IO companies may be forced to combine checkpoint inhibitors with a Gal 3 blocker as more data comes out Who will demand it The consumer dying of cancer who sees the literature Just one famous person with cancer that is Gal 3 positive and not responding to Keytruda will make that happen That brings in money and solidifies their balance sheet as NASH P3 happens I dont understand why you are so pessimistic
str8bite,,2019-05-31 13:19:00,4,GALT The science is profound but we are 34 years waiting on nash data and have to raise 50mm will dilute before we ever get big payout
