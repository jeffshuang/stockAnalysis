TesttheWaters,,2019-05-31 09:54:00,3.375,CPRX Catalyst Pharma rival unlikely to be covered for adults by insurers SunTrust 902am ET 05312019 ReutersA rival drug to Catalyst Pharmaceuticals Firdapse has a low chance of being reimbursed by payers for its use in adults with LambertEaton myasthenic syndrome LEMS SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Edward Nash says CPRX won approval for its drug Firdapse in November to treat adults with LEMS a rare autoimmune disorder However earlier this month FDA unexpectedly granted privatelyheld Jacobus Pharma approval for a rival drug Ruzurgi to treat children with LEMS sparking fears that it would erode Firdapses market share Physicians are unlikely to prescribe and payers are unlikely to reimburse Ruzurgi given Firdapse is the only approved product for adult LEMS patients Nash says We believe shares of CPRX are significantly undervalued at current levels he says
keremoner,,2019-05-31 09:44:00,3.376,CPRX actually my thesis is that what is viewed as bad news for the economy in general such as trade wars effect certain stocks less Those would be what might be viewed as potentially undervalued stocks and value stocks including certain biotechs that are at critical junctions where their revenues are likely to explode soon and disruptors like LC Money that is fleeing directly affected stocks everything from Apple to Ford has only the options of lower yield investments or value stocks as well as certain biotechs I believe likes of CPRX and NBRV are just such companies Hang in there and we will be rewarded soon
