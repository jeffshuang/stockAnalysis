WiseInvestor1,True,2019-05-31 15:36:00,6.27,TGTX This price action makes no sense at all especially with volume this pathetic The algos are just driving it lower the Big Boys are just getting greedy now today for example when it couldnt get past 650 cleanly algos pushed it into the 640s the 630s 620s I think theyre using a bad market day to force it lower The Big Buys will come in next week or last 30 mins Still confounded but know its mostly manipulation here Im going with the Analysts
